    "text": "1 - Diabetes mellitus is A metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion or action, or a combination of both. ≈ 95% comprised by T2DM. An important contributor to vascular damage inducing a high risk of macro-and microvascular complications.   2 - Identification Screening for T2DM can be implemented using a non-invasive risk score (e.g. FINDRISC) supplemented by the assessment of glycaemia in people at high risk. Diagnosis of DM can be made by the measurement of FPG (>7.0 mmol/L), 2hPG (>11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c (>6.5%). HbA1c <6.5% does not exclude a diagnosis of diabetes which should be further investigated by OGTT in people at high risk of disturbed glucose metabolism. Abnormal PG or HbA1c test results should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis.   3 - Prevention Progression of IGT to DM can be delayed by lifestyle intervention in about 50% of individuals. The intervention effect is sustained after lifestyle counselling has ceased. Pharmacotherapies (a-glucosidase inhibitors, metformin, glitazones, insulin, ARBs) can delay progression to DM in people with IGT whilst the drug is taken.   4 - Assessment of individual cardiovascular risk Classical risk factors (family history, lifestyle, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia). Glycaemic status. Macrovascular disease (coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral artery disease, heart failure). Microvascular disease (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy). Arrhythmias especially atrial fibrillation.   5 - Multifactorial management of cardiovascular risk Patient education and empowerment. Life style advice. Smoking cessation. Personalised treatment of blood pressure, lipids, glucose and thrombotic risk.   6 - Life style intervention Daily consumption of vegetable and fruits. Increased dietary fibre intake. Moderate intake of simple carbohydrates. Reduced total dietary fat intake. Replacement of saturated fat by monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fat. Physical activity >30 min/day or at least 150 min/week. Weight reduction >5% if BMI >25 kg/m2. Moderate alcohol consumption.   7 - Key targets* for prevention of cardiovascular disease BP <140/85 mmHg. LDL cholesterol <1.8 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL). HbA1c <7% (<53 mmol/mol). *These targets should be applied with individual needs taken into account.   8 - Multifactorial medical management A combination of blood pressure lowering agents is often required to achieve control and RAAS blockade should be part of the treatment. Lipid control is based on statins. Antiplatelet therapy is recommended for secondary prevention of CVD. A combination of glucose lowering agents is often required to achieve glycaemic control and metformin should be considered as first line treatment especially in overweight/obese patients.   9 - Options for revascularisation Acute coronary syndromes Early angiography and culprit lesion revascularization should be offered. Stable coronary artery disease CABG is preferred if the myocardial area at risk is large (multi-vessel disease, complex coronary lesions). PCI with DES may be performed for symptom control in single- and two-vessel disease. Peripheral artery disease Critical limb ischaemia and symptomatic carotid artery disease should be revascularised.   10 - Heart failure T2DM is a major risk factor for the development of heart failure. The combination of DM and heart failure has a 12-fold higher mortality than DM alone. Pharmacological management include combinations of RAAS inhibitors, beta blockade and diuretic therapy. Non-pharmacological approaches should be considered as in patients without DM .   11 - Multidisciplinary strategies Comprehensive care of DM patients often requires collaboration between specialists in cardiology, diabetology and primary care and several other subspecialties such as surgery ophthalmology, nephrology and psychiatry. Nurses, dieticians, podiatrists and physiotherapists and care professionals are important collaborators.",

Patient-centred care fosters a multifactorial approach, working within the context of patient priorities and goals, and allows for lifestyle changes and treatments to be adapted and implemented within cultural beliefs and behaviours. Providers should take into account age, ethnic and gender differences in DM and CVD including lifestyle, disease prevalence and presentation, response to treatment, and outcomes. Patient-centred care is recommended to facilitate shared control and decisionmaking within the context of patient priorities and goals. Patient-centred cognitive behavioural strategies are recommended to help patients achieve lifestyle changes and practise self-management.

The WHO criteria are based on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2hPG concentrations using an OGTT. ADA encourages the use of HbA1c, and FPG, and an OGTT is indicated only if HbA1c and/or FPG is incon­clusive (Table 4). The argument for FPG or HbA1c over 2hPG is primarily related to feasibility. HbA1c has a low sensitivity to predict DM and values <6.5% do not exclude DM that may be disclosed by an OGTT. As depicted in Figure 2, FPG and 2hPG identify different people with previously unrecognized DM and the 2hPG contributes the best prognostic the 2hPG contributes the best prognostic information. The diagnosis of DM should be based on at least two consecutive values above the diagnostic threshold. HbA1c is a useful measure of glycaemic control in people with reflecting a average value of blood glucose during the preceding 6-8 weeks (the life span of erythrocytes).

The early glucometabolic impairment is characterized by a progressive decrease in insulin sensitivity and increased glucose levels that remain below the threshold for a diagnosis of T2DM, a state known as IGT. Over many years this leads to the development of atherosclerotic plaques which, in the presence of enhanced inflammatory content, becomes unstable and rupture to promote occlusive thrombus formation. Atheroma from people with DM has more lipid, inflammatory changes, and thrombus than a subject free of DM. Figure 4:  Glycaemic continuum and cardiovascular disease.",

In very obese individuals bariatric surgery causes long-term weight loss and reduces the rate of incident T2DM and mortality.   Dietary interventions are presently less prescriptive than before and acknowledge that several dietary patterns can be adopted. An appropriate intake of total energy and a diet in which fruits, vegetables, wholegrain cereals, and low-fat protein sources predominate are more important than the precise proportions of total energy provided by the major macronutrients. Salt intake should be restricted. It has been suggested there is no benefit in a high-protein over a high-carbohydrate diet in T2DM. Specific dietary recommendations include limiting saturated and trans fats and alcohol intake, monitoring carbohydrate consumption, and increasing dietary fibre. Routine supple­mentation with antioxidants, such as vitamins E and C and carotene, is not advised. A Mediterranean-type diet is acceptable provided fat sources are derived primarily from mono­unsaturated oils. Moderate amounts of alcohol are associated with a lower risk of CVD than no intake at all. Intake of >4 cups of coffee/day is associated with a lower risk of CVD in people with T2DM, but boiled coffee without filtering raises LDL-C and should be avoided.   Physical activity is important in the prevention of the development of T2DM in people with IGT, and for the control of glycaemia and related CVD complications. Regular exercise is necessary for continued benefit. Combined aerobic and resistance training has a more favourable impact on HbA1c than aerobic or resistance training alone. Physical activity decreases HbA1c and is more effective when combined with dietary advice.   Smoking increases the risk of T2DM, CVD, and premature death. People with DM, who are current smokers, should be offered a structured smoking cessation programme with pharma­co­logical support. Detailed instruction should be given according to the five A principles (Table 6).

However, intensive glucose control combined with effective blood pressure control and lipid lowering appear to markedly shorten the time to improvements in the rate of cardio­vascular events. A meta-analysis of CV outcomes suggest that an HbA1c reduction of ~1% is associated with a 15% relative risk reduction (RRR) in non-fatal MI but without benefits on stroke or all-cause mortality. However, patients with a short duration of T2DM, lower baseline HbA1c at randomization and without a history of CVD seem to benefit from more intensive glucose-lowering strategies. Intensive glycaemic control should therefore be applied in an individualized manner taking into account age, duration of T2DM, and history of CVD. A HbA1c target of <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol) to reduce microvascular disease is a generally accepted level. The evidence for an HbA1c target in relation to macrovascular risk is less compelling. Consensus indicates that an HbA1c of ≤7% should be targeted. Ideally, tight control should be instigated early in the course of the disorder in younger persons without co­morbi­dities. FPG should be <6.7 mmol/L (<120 mg/dL) and post-prandial <9–10 mmol/L (<160–180 mg/dL) on an individualized basis.

Dyslipidaemia is a major risk factor for CVD in people with DM. Characteristically in insulin resistant it comprises elevation of triglycerides, small dense LDL particles, and low HDL cholesterol. A low HDL-C is an independent CVD risk factor even if the LDL-C level is not elevated. Indeed the malignant nature of dyslipidaemia can be better characterized by using non-HDL-C in T2DM because LDL-C often remains within a normal range. Comprehensive and consistent data exist on the efficacy of statins in the prevention of CVD events in T2DM. An observed 9% reduction in all-cause mortality and a 21% reduction in the incidence of major vascular outcomes per mmol/L of LDL-C lowering are similar to those seen in non-DM. The benefit associated with the reduction in LDL-C was seen at a starting level as low as 2.6 mmol/L.   The risk reduction is similar in patients with T1DM and T2DM. The benefit of statins in DM patients greatly exceeds any known hazards of such therapy.   The pharmacological tools available to raise HDL-C in DM patients remain limited and safety concerns have been raised. So far, lifestyle intervention with smoking cessation, increased physical activity, weight reduction, and decreased consumption of fast-absorbed carbohydrates remains the cornerstone of HDL raising therapy.",

In this document the discussion of stroke and transitory ischaemic attack (TIA) prevention is limited to aspects related to carotid artery disease. Although the presence of DM increases the likelihood of carotid artery disease, its presence does not change the general diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Carotid bruits are common in patients with carotid artery stenosis although many remain asymptomatic regardless of lesion severity. Urgent imaging of the brain and supra-aortic vessels with duplex ultrasonography, computed tomography angiography, and magnetic resonance imaging is mandatory in patients presenting with TIA or stroke. Management depends on symptoms, severity of the lesion, prognosis for 5-year survival, and the outcome of revascularization procedures. A management algorithm is shown in Figure 7.

    "text": "Management of microvascular disease in diabetes Recommendations Classa Levelb Screening for the presence of retinopathy should be considered on annual basis in patients with T2DM. IIa B Multifactorial therapy is recommended when retinopathy is progressing rapidly. I B An HbA1c <7% and a blood pressure <140/85 mmHg are recommended for primary prevention of retinopathy related to DM. I A Lipid lowering should be considered to reduce the progression of retinopathy, the need for laser treatment, and the need for vitrectomy. IIa B It is recommended that proliferative DM retinopathy is treated by pan retinal laser photocoagulation. I A Grid laser photocoagulation should be considered in clinically significant macular oedema. IIa B Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy should be considered in patients with vision impairment and clinically significant macular oedema involving the fovea. IIa B BP = blood pressure; DM = diabetes mellitus; HbA1c  = glycated haemoglobin A1c; T2DM = type 2 diabetes mellitus. a Class of recommendation. b Level of evidence. DM is an important risk factor for both renal and CV outcomes, and renal impairment – in the form of elevated urinary albumin excretion and/or impaired GFR – is itself an independent predictor of CV outcomes. Urinary albumin excretion and loss of GFR are to some extent beneficially modifiable by interventions that lower blood glucose and blood pressure.   Retinopathy is the most frequent microvascular complication in DM. Although the incidence has declined slowly following the implementation of intensive treatment regimens, vision-threatening proliferative retinopathy affects 50% of subjects with T1DM, and 29% with T2DM develop vision-threatening macular oedema. Rapidly progressive retinopathy indicates increased CV risk, and the combination of retinopathy and nephropathy predicts excess CV morbidity and mortality. In T2DM advanced retinopathy more than doubles the risk for CV outcomes.   A multifactorial treatment approach prevents both microvascular and CV outcomes with a long-term beneficial effect both in T1DM and T2DM.",

    "text": "Lifestyle intervention. There is no proof that lifestyle interventions alone have an effect on the prevention of nephropathy, neuropathy or retinopathy.   Glycaemic control prevents microvascular and cardiovascular outcomes both in T1DM and T2DM.   The recommended target for HbA1c in both T1DM and T2DM is <7% (<53 mmol/mol). Beyond a certain level of retinal damage, euglycaemia no longer provides a benefit against progression of retinopathy.   Blood pressure. As a primary intervention, intensified blood pressure control using RAAS blockers prevents the onset of microalbuminuria in T2DM but not in T1DM. As a secondary intervention, intensified blood pressure control using ACE-I to block the RAAS slowed progression of kidney disease in T1DM and reduced end-stage renal failure. In T2DM, high doses of ramipril prevented both renal and CV outcomes. ARBs reduced progression from microalbuminuria to proteinuria, and prevented renal outcomes, but not CV death.   Blood pressure control has beneficial effects on the progression of retinopathy. The recom­mended threshold is <140/85 mmHg, although other concomitant conditions such as nephropathy may require more intensive blood pressure control (systolic <130 mmHg). Lowering blood pressure to this target does not adversely affect retinopathy.   Lipid-lowering. Interventions on blood lipids and platelet aggregation have not been documented to alter renal disease in DM. Recently, statin plus ezetimibe provided cardiovascular protection in people with reduced kidney function including those with DM. There are no clear target levels of lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides) for the prevention or retardation of retinopathy.",

Effective strategies for supporting patients to achieve positive lifestyle changes and improve self-management can be recommended. Patient-centred care fosters a multifactorial approach, working within the context of patient priorities and goals, and allows for lifestyle changes and treatments to be adapted and implemented within cultural beliefs and behaviours. Providers should take into account age, ethnic, and gender differences in DM and CVD, including lifestyle, disease prevalence, and presentation, response to treatment, and outcomes. Cognitive behavioural strategies, including problem-solving, goal setting, self-monitoring, ongoing support, and feedback/positive reinforcement in individual or group-based sessions are effective in facilitating behavioural change, especially when multiple strategies are used. When this approach is used by a multidisciplinary team with skills in cognitive behavioural strategies, there will be increased success in supporting patients to achieve lifestyle changes, and to effectively self-manage their conditions.",

    "text": "SCAD is generally characterized by episodes of reversible myocardial demand/supply mismatch related to ischaemia or hypoxia which are usually inducible by exercise, emotion or other stress and reproducible, but which may also be occurring spontaneously. Such episodes of ischaemia/hypoxia are commonly associated with transient chest discomfort (angina pectoris). SCAD also includes the stabilised, often asymptomatic, phases that follow an ACS. Finally, SCAD also comprises the long silent pre-symptomatic state of coronary arteriosclerosis. Angina at rest caused by coronary vasospasm is regarded within the scope of SCAD. The main features of SCAD are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Main features of SCAD Pathogenesis Stable anatomical atherosclerotic and/or functional alterations of epicardial vessels and/or microcirculation. Natural history Stable symptomatic or asymptomatic phases which may be interrupted by ACS. Mechanisms of myocardial ischaemia Fixed or dynamic stenoses of epicardial coronary arteries; Microvascular dysfunction; Focal or diffuse epicardial coronary spasm; The above mechanisms may overlap in the same patient and change over time. Clinical presentations Effort induced angina caused by: epicardial stenoses; microvascular dysfunction; vasoconstriction at the site of dynamic stenosis; combination of the above. Rest angina caused by: Vasospasm (focal or diffuse) epicardial focal; epicardial diffuse; microvascular; combination of the above. Asymptomatic: because of lack of ischaemia and/or of LV dysfunction; despite ischaemia and/or LV dysfunction. Ischaemic cardiomyopathy ACS = acute coronary syndrome; LV = left ventricular; SCAD = stable coronary artery disease. Whereas the various clinical presentations of SCAD are related to obstruction of the epicardial arteries caused by coronary plaques, to focal or diffuse spasm of normal or plaque-diseased arteries, microvascular dysfunction and/or ischaemia cardiomyopathy if present, stable coronary plaques with and without previous revascularization may also be completely clinically silent.",

    "text": "The document outlines an innovative classification of bradyarrhythmias by mechanism. There are three main groups: persistent bradycardia, intermittent bradycardia with electrocardiographic documentation, and suspected intermittent bradycardia (not yet documented). Recommendations are provided for the three categories. Until now, guidelines and text books have classified bradyarrhythmias according to their aetiology, for example sinus node dysfunction, myocardial infarction, or bundle branch block. Classification of bradyarrhythmias according to mechanism (i.e., the clinical presentation) is more useful for selecting patients for permanent cardiac pacing therapy than their aetiology. The strength of indications for CRT focuses mainly on the presence or absence of left bundle branch block. Unique recommendations are given for NYHA class II and III patients. A spectrum of response to CRT, as with most other treatments, is recognized: the beneficial effects of CRT may be greater in females, patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy and patients with QRS duration >150 ms (the longer the QRS duration, the greater the benefit). Different recommendations are given for an upgrade or “de novo“ implantation of CRT in patients with a brady indication for pacing. Clinical guidance to the choice between CRT-P or CRT-D in primary prevention is provided. In the decision process for indication for pacing/CRT and for the choice of the best modality attention should be paid to a careful evaluation of the risk of complications. In general the risk of complications is higher when implanting more complex devices and for re-intervention and upgrades.",

    "text": "Summary card (Pacing) Overview The diagnosis of bradyarrhythmia is usually made from a standard ECG when persistent, and from a standard ECG or more prolonged ECG recordings [ambulatory monitoring or implantable loop recorder (ILR)] when intermittent. Provocative testing or an electrophysiological study (EPS) may be required when a bradycardia is suspected but not documented. Since there is no defined heart rate below which treatment is indicated, correlation between symptoms and bradyarrhythmia is essential when deciding on the need for cardiac pacing therapy. This can be difficult to establish in patients with competing mechanisms for their symptoms. In general, an attempt to obtain ECG documentation during syncope (symptom-arrhythmia correlation) is warranted (see below).",

Cardiac dyssynchrony is complex and multifaceted. Prolongation of the AV interval delays systolic contraction, inter- and intra-ventricular conduction delays lead to asynchronous contraction of LV wall regions (ventricular dyssynchrony). Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) helps to restore AV, inter- and intra-ventricular synchrony, improving LV function, reducing functional mitral regurgitation and inducing LV reverse remodelling.",

The evidence for recommending CRT in patients with NYHA class I is in conclusive due to the low number of patients enrolled in RCTs. The evidence for recommending CRT in patients with NYHA class IV is inconclusive due to the low number of patients enrolled in RCTs. However, an individual situation should be taken in account especially for NYHA class IV patients who have had no scheduled or unscheduled HF hospitalizations during the last month (termed “ambulatory” Class IV) in order to reduce hospitalizations and to improve symptoms LBBB morphology is required in class I recommendation. Sub-analyses of randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that the beneficial effects of CRT were observed in patients with typical LBBB. Sub-analyses from randomized clinical trials suggest that the beneficial effects of CRT on morbidity and mortality and LV function may be greater in females, patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy and patients with QRS duration >150 ms (the longer the QRS duration, the greater the benefit). The evidence of benefit in patients with non-LBBB configuration is weak particularly in patients with QRS <150 ms and NYHA class I and II. RBBB most often implies worse disease state than LBBB and is generally expected not be benefit from CRT. For these patients the decision to implant a CRT should be individualized based on other clinical/ imaging criteria. There is no evidence of benefit from CRT for patients with QRS <120 msec.

    "text": "Patients with sinus node disease are generally old and frequently have a concomitant heart disease. In these situations, the demonstration of a clear cause-effect relationship between symptoms and sinus node disease is often difficult to achieve. It is crucial to distinguish between physiological bradycardia due to autonomic conditions or training effects and inappropriate bradycardia that requires permanent cardiac pacing. For example, SB (even when it is 40–50 beats/min while at rest or as slow as 30 beats/min while sleeping) is accepted as a physiological finding that does not require cardiac pacing in trained athletes. When bradycardia is induced or exacerbated by concomitant drugs affecting sinus node function, drug discontinuation should be considered as an alternative to cardiac pacing. Reducing drug dose, may not resolve the bradycardia. Choice of pacing mode/programming in patients with persistent bradycardia Recommendations Classa Levelb 7) Sinus node disease. 7A) Dual-chamber PM with preservation of spontaneous AV conduction is indicated for reducing the risk of AF and stroke, avoiding PM syndrome and improving quality of life.

Ventricular pacing with rate-response function is recommended. I C AF = atrial fibrillation; AV = atrioventricular; PM = pacemaker. a Class of recommendation; b Level of evidence. Clinical perspectives: In patients with sinus node disease, dual-chamber pacing confers a modest reduction in AF and stroke but not in hospitalization for heart failure or death compared to ventricular pacing. Dual-chamber pacing reduces the risk of PM syndrome which occurs in more than a quarter of patients either with sinus node disease and AV block. PM syndrome is associated with a reduction in quality of life and often justifies the preference for dual-chamber pacing. Even if it is a softer end-point, PM syndrome is associated with a reduction in quality of life and justifies the preference for dual-chamber pacing when reasonable. In patients with AV block, dual-chamber pacing does not reduce morbidity (hospitalization, HF) or mortality compared with ventricular pacing. In patients with AV block (including those with SB and long PR interval) who will probably require a high percentage of ventricular pacing, CRT should be considered if clinical symptoms of HF and a severely reduced LVEF are present. Advice for follow-up: Mode-switch algorithm is advised to be activated. Evolution of AF during follow-up should be assessed by the diagnostics of the device with a view to anticoagulant therapy when necessary. Rate-response function should be properly programmed at implantation and reassessed during follow-up. Finally, the percentage of ventricular pacing should be assessed at each follow-up in order to minimize it as much as possible.",

In patients with BBB and severe systolic LV dysfunction an ICD/CRT-D implantation should be considered instead of PM. In patients with previous myocardial infarction and BBB, EPS with programmed ventricular stimulation is particularly advisable. If a sustained ventricular tachycardia is induced, ICD must be implanted instead of a PM.

III B aClass of recommendation; bLevel of evidence Clinical perspectives Carotid sinus syncope: The decision to implant a pacemaker should be made in the context of a relatively benign condition with the aim of preventing traumatic recurrences which are frequent in old patients with recurrent carotid sinus syncope. Since carotid sinus syndrome does not affect survival, the reduction of the burden of syncope, i.e. number of syncopes per patient per year, and the reduction of related morbidities, i.e. trauma secondary to syncope, should probably describe better the benefit of cardiac pacing therapy. Compared with the natural history of carotid sinus syndrome, we can expect that the patients who receive a pacemaker will have about a 75% reduction of recurrences. However, syncopal recurrences are still expected to occur in up to 20% of paced patients within 5 years (Figure 5). Mixed form of CSS and VVI mode hamper the efficacy of pacing therapy. In addition, cardiac pacing is not effective in preventing pre-syncopal recurrences. Figure 5: Recurrence of syncope in untreated and paced patients affected by carotid sinus syndrome (CSS). Reproduced with permission from Brignole et al.(35) The natural history of carotid sinus syncope and effects of cardiac pacing. Europace 2011;13:462–464. Tilt-induced vasovagal syncope: The fact that pacing may be effective does not mean that it is also always necessary. It must be emphasized that the decision to implant a pacemaker needs to be made in the clinical context of a benign condition which frequently affects young patients. Thus, cardiac pacing should be limited as a last resort choice to a highly selected small proportion of patients affected by severe reflex syncope. Probably patients suitable for cardiac pacing are those >60 years with a history of recurrent syncope beginning in middle or older ages and with frequent injuries probably due to presentation without warning. Syncopal recurrences are still expected to occur despite cardiac pacing in a minority of patients.

Therefore, this Task Force agreed to give unique recom­mendations for all patients with symptomatic HF and severely depressed LVEF. The evidence for recommending CRT in patients with NYHA class I is inconclusive due to the low number of patients enrolled in RCTs. The evidence for recommending CRT in patients with NYHA class IV is inconclusive due to the low number of patients enrolled in RCTs. However, an individual situation should be taken in account especially for NYHA class IV patients who have had no scheduled or unscheduled HF hospitalizations during the last month (termed “ambulatory” Class IV) in order to reduce hospitalizations and to improve symptoms. Patients with LBBB QRS morphology are most likely to benefit from CRT therapy. Sub-analyses of randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that the beneficial effects of CRT were observed in patients with typical LBBB. Sub-analyses from randomized clinical trials suggest that the beneficial effects of CRT on morbidity and mortality and LV function may be greater in females, patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy and patients with QRS duration >150 ms (the longer the QRS duration, the greater the benefit) (Figure 7). The low number of HF patients with non-LBBB configuration included in randomized controlled trials precludes firm conclusions for CRT implantation in this subgroup of patients. The evidence of benefit in patients with non-LBBB configuration is weak particularly in patients with QRS <150 ms and NYHA classes I and II. Patients with RBBB QRS morphology are generally expected not to benefit from CRT. For these patients the decision to implant a CRT should be individualized based on other clinical/imaging criteria.

Current evidence does not strongly support the performance of AV and VV optimization routinely in all patients receiving CRT (Table 7). In non-responders to CRT, evaluation of AV and VV delay may be recom­mended in order to correct suboptimal device settings. LV pacing alone, in non-pacemaker dependent patients, seems to be non-inferior to biventricular pacing for improving soft end-points (quality of life, exercise capacity and LV reverse remodelling) and might be considered to lower the costs and complexity of the procedure and to increase the longevity of the device.

    "text": "Owing to the heterogeneity of published studies, it is difficult to identify the brady-paced population that may benefit from upgrading to CRT. In general, however, it seems that patients who might benefit are those who, early or late after conventional permanent RV pacing, have a deterioration of LV function (e.g. significant reduction of EF to <35%), relevant worsening of symptoms of HF and hospitalizations for HF, despite optimal medical therapy. Owing to the lack of high quality evidence, the indication for CRT remains largely individual. Late upgrade after HF development seems to provide similar benefit to “de novo” implan­tation in patients with initial preserved cardiac function. Therefore, a strategy of initially conventional antibrady pacing with later upgrade in case of worsening symptoms seems reasonable. In patients being considered for “de novo” implantation, it is important to distinguish to which extent clinical presentation may be secondary to the underlying bradyarrhythmia rather than LV dysfunction. This is often difficult to recognize. In the decision process of upgraded and “de novo” CRT pacing instead of conventional RV pacing, physicians should take into account the added complication rate related to the more complex biventricular system, the shorter longevity of CRT devices with the consequent need for earlier pacemaker replacement and the excess of costs.",

IIb C AV = atrioventricular. aClass of recommendation. bLevel of evidence. Since children are paced for a lifetime, they are prone to a higher incidence of long-term adverse events and are at high risk of experiencing the adverse consequences of cardiac stimulation at a non-optimal site. Because of a small body size, the presence of a congenital defect with a right-to-left shunt, or postoperative absence of transvenous access to the target chamber, children often need to be permanently paced epicardially. Children’s higher activity levels lead to greater stress on device hardware and their growth expectancy leads to higher incidence of lead dislodgement or fracture in follow-up. Concerns have been voiced regarding the long-term performance of endocardial leads in children, given the high incidence of abandonment, potential valvular injury and vascular crowding. Clinical perspectives: An individualized evaluation of the benefits versus potential complications of pacemaker implant is recom­mended, taking into consideration the cardiac and venous anatomy, patient size and growth expectancy. The decision to implant a pacemaker in children is done in collaboration with paediatric cardiologists and should preferably be done in a specialized centre.",

Exclude patients with leads that have not matured (<6 weeks since implantation, during which the leads are prone to spontaneous dislodgement) and those with epicardial and abandoned leads (which are prone to heating). Programme an asynchronous pacing mode in PM-dependent patients to avoid inappropriate inhibition of pacing due to detection of electromagnetic interference. In contrast, use an inhibited pacing mode for patients without PM dependence to avoid inappropriate pacing due to tracking of electromagnetic interference. Deactivate other pacing functions (magnet, rate, noise, PVC, ventricular sense, AF response) in order to ensure that sensing of electromagnetic interference does not lead to unwarranted pacing.

    "text": "Introduction These present guidelines are intended for physicians and collaborators involved in the pre-, peri-, and post-operative care of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. The guidelines focus on the cardiovascular management of patients in whom heart disease is a potential source of complications during non-cardiac surgery. The risk of peri-operative complications depends on the condition of the patient before surgery, the prevalence of comorbidities, and the urgency, magnitude, type, and duration of the surgical procedure. More specifically, cardiac complications can arise in patients with documented or asymptomatic ischaemic heart disease (IHD), left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, valvular heart disease (VHD), and arrhythmias, who undergo surgical procedures that are associated with prolonged haemodynamic and cardiac stress. Worldwide, non-cardiac surgery is associated with an average overall annual complication rate of between 7% and 11% and a mortality rate between 0.8% and 1.5% depending on safety precautions. Up to 42% of these are caused by cardiac complications. When applied to the population in the European Union member states, these figures translate into at least 167,000 cardiac complications, of which 19,000 are life-threatening, due to non-cardiac surgical procedures annually. The guidelines recommend a practical, stepwise evaluation that integrates clinical risk factors and test results with the estimated stress of the planned surgical procedure. This results in an individualized cardiac risk assessment, with the opportunity to initiate medical therapy, coronary interventions, and specific surgical and anaesthetic techniques in order to optimize the patient’s peri-operative condition. The majority of patients with stable heart disease can undergo low and intermediate risk surgery without additional evaluation. Selected patients require evaluation by a team of integrated multidisciplinary specialists including anaesthesiologists, cardiologists, and surgeons, and when appropriate an extended team. Anaesthesiologists will usually coordinate the pre-operative evaluation. Selected patients include those with suspected or known cardiac disease with sufficient complexity to carry a potential peri-operative risk (e.g. congenital heart disease, unstable symptoms, or low functional capacity), patients in whom pre-operative medical optimization is expected to reduce peri-operative risk before low- and intermediate-risk surgery, and patients with known or high-risk of cardiac disease undergoing high-risk surgery. Recommendations on pre-operative evaluation   Class a Level b Selected patients with cardiac disease undergoing low- and intermediate-risk non-cardiac surgery may be referred by the anaesthesiologist for cardiological evaluation and medical optimization. IIb C A multidisciplinary expert team should be considered for pre-operative evaluation of patients with known or high-risk of cardiac disease undergoing high-risk non-cardiac surgery.

    "text": "Pre-operative cardiac risk assessment Introduction In order to reduce the risk of peri-operative cardiac complications it is essential to perform cardiac evaluation using the patient’s medical history prior to the surgical procedure. The patients with an anticipated low risk of cardiac death and MI (< 1%) can be operated on safely without further delay. The risk reduction by pharmacological treatment or other interventions is most cost-effective with high procedural risk and in patients with increased cardiac risk. In addition to the clinical history, surgical risk and functional capacity, biomarkers and non-invasive cardiac imaging techniques can further help in assessing the risk, but these techniques should be reserved only for those patients in whom test results would influence and change the management.",

If the estimated surgical risk in cardiac stable patients is low (< 1%), it is unlikely that test results will change management and it would be appropriate to proceed with the planned surgical procedure. In patients with clinical risk factors resting ECG may be considered (see risk factors in Table at Step 6). The physician can identify risk factors and provide recommendations on lifestyle and medical therapy to improve long-term outcome. In patients with one or more clinical risk factors, pre-operative baseline ECG may be considered to monitor changes during the peri-operative period. In patients with known IHD or myocardial ischaemia, initiation of a titrated low-dose beta-blocker regimen may be considered before surgery (see here for details). In patients with heart failure and systolic dysfunction, ACEI or ARB should be considered before surgery. In patients undergoing vascular surgery, initiation of statin therapy should be considered.

If an asymptomatic or cardiac-stable patient has moderate or good functional capacity (≥ 4 METs i.e ability to climb two flights of stairs or run a short distance), the prognosis is good, even in the presence of stable IHD or risk factors. Then peri-operative management is unlikely to be changed on the basis of further test results, irrespective of the planned surgical procedure. Even in the presence of clinical risk factors, it is appropriate to refer the patient for surgery.

    "text": "Step 7 Interpretation of non-invasive stress test results: patients without stress-induced ischaemia, or with mild-to-moderate ischaemia suggestive of one- or two-vessel disease, can proceed with the planned surgical procedure. In patients with extensive stress-induced ischaemia, as assessed by non-invasive testing, individualized peri-operative management is recommended, taking into consideration the potential benefit of the proposed surgical procedure compared with the predicted adverse outcome. Also, the effect of medical therapy and/or coronary revascularization must be assessed, not only for immediate post-operative outcome, but also for long-term follow-up. In patients referred for percutaneous coronary artery intervention, the initiation and duration of anti-platelet therapy will interfere with the planned surgical procedure: In patients referred for balloon-only angioplasty non-cardiac surgery can be performed > 2 weeks after intervention, with continuation of aspirin treatment. In patients with bare-metal stent placement non-cardiac surgery can be performed > 4 weeks after the intervention. Dual anti-platelet therapy should be continued for at least 4 weeks. In patients with recent drug-eluting stent placement non-cardiac surgery can be performed 12 months after the intervention with old-generation DES and 6 months with the new-generation DES, during this period dual anti-platelet therapy is recommended. In other situations, continuation of aspirin in patients previously treated with aspirin may be considered in the peri-operative period, and should be based on an individual decision that depends on the peri-operative bleeding risk weighed against the risk of thrombotic complications (see also Summary Table). Discontinuation of aspirin therapy should be considered in those in whom haemostasis is anticipated difficult to control during surgery.",

Several risk indices have been developed although they provide only a rough estimation, the risk-stratification systems may represent useful clinical tools for physicians regarding the need for cardiac evaluation and drug treatment. Risk models do not dictate management decisions, but should be regarded as one piece of the puzzle to be evaluated in concert with the more traditional information at the physician’s disposal. Data on pre-operative biomarker use from prospective controlled trials are sparse. Based on the present data, assessment of serum biomarkers for patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery cannot be proposed for routine use, but may be considered in high-risk patients (METs ≤ 4 or with a revised cardiac risk index value > 1 for vascular surgery and > 2 for non-vascular surgery).

The underlying principle here is that the diagnostic algorithm of risk stratification of myocardial ischaemia and LV function should be similar to that proposed for patients in the non-surgical setting with known or suspected IHD.

Besides specific risk-reduction strategies adapted to patient characteristics and type of surgery, pre-operative evaluation can optimize the control of cardiovascular risk factors. The main rationale for peri-operative beta-blocker use is to decrease myocardial oxygen consumption by reducing heart rate, leading to a longer diastolic filling period and decreased myocardial contractility. Additional cardioprotective factors have been suggested. Treatment onset and the choice of the optimal dose of beta-blockers are closely linked. Post-operative outcome is improved in patients who have a lower heart rate. On the other hand, bradycardia and hypotension should be avoided.

The risk is highly variable according to the type and severity of VHD and the type of non-cardiac surgery. Pre-operative echocardiography should be performed in patients with known or suspected VHD, in particular in the presence of a cardiac murmur. Aortic stenosis is the most common VHD and constitutes a well-established risk factor for peri-operative mortality and myocardial infarction. In patients with severe aortic stenosis, procedures should be performed under more invasive haemodynamic monitoring, avoiding rapid changes in volume status and heart rhythm. In symptomatic patients, aortic valve replacement should be considered before elective surgery if feasible. In patients at high-risk balloon aortic valvuloplasty or preferably transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) may be a reasonable therapeutic option. In asymptomatic patients, non-cardiac surgery of low- to intermediate-risk can be safely performed. If possible, the absence of symptoms should be confirmed by exercise testing. If high-risk surgery is planned, further clinical assessment is necessary to assess the risk of aortic valve replacement. Non-cardiac surgery can be performed at relatively low risk in patients with non-significant mitral stenosis (valve area > 1.5 cm2) and in asymptomatic patients with significant mitral stenosis and systolic pulmonary artery pressure < 50 mmHg. The asymptomatic patients with more severe mitral stenosis and in symptomatic patients may benefit from percutaneous mitral commissurotomy (or open surgical repair) particularly before high-risk surgery.

    "text": "Disturbed glucose metabolism Surgery in patients with diabetes is associated with longer hospital stay, higher healthcare resource use, and greater peri-operative mortality. Critical illness is also characterized by dysglycaemia, which may develop in the absence of previously diagnosed diabetes, and has repeatedly been identified as an important risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Hyperglycaemia has adverse effect on renal and hepatic function, endothelial function, and immune response. Minimization of the degree of glucose variability may be cardioprotective. In patients with diabetes, pre-operative or preprocedural assessment should be undertaken to identify and optimize comorbidities, and determine the periprocedural diabetes management strategy. Evidence for strict blood glucose control for patients without known diabetes undergoing non-cardiac surgery is controversial. Recommendations on blood glucose control   Class a Level b Post-operative prevention of hyperglycaemia [targeting levels at least < 10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL)] by intravenous insulin therapy is recommended in adults after high-risk surgery that requires admission to the intensive care unit.

    "text": "Anaesthesia The optimal peri-operative course for high-risk cardiovascular patients should be based on a close cooperation between cardiologists, surgeons, pulmonologists, and anaesthesiologists. Pre-operative risk assessment and pre-operative optimization of cardiac disease should be performed jointly. Intra-operative anaesthetic management Anaesthesiological management must ensure proper maintenance of organ flow and perfusion pressure. Efforts should be made to prevent intra-operative arterial hypotension and inadequately deep anaesthesia level. The choice of the anaesthetic agent has been considered of little importance with regard to patient outcome provided that vital functions are adequately supported. There is conflicting evidence whether a specific anaesthetic agent is advantageous in patients with cardiac disease, with the suggestion that volatile anaesthetic agents offer better cardioprotection than intravenous anaesthetic agents. For non-cardiac surgery, data are scarce. Neuraxial techniques The benefit of neuraxial anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia is highly debated in the literature. Randomized studies and a meta-analysis of several randomized clinical trials in non-cardiac surgery patients comparing outcomes with regional and general anaesthetic techniques have shown some evidence of improved outcome and reduced post-operative morbidity with regional anesthesia. Neuraxial anaesthesia has not systematically decreased the risk of myocardial infarction or mortality but associated with a lower risk of other complications and may be considered for the management of patients with cardiovascular risk factors or diseases without contra-indications. Cardiac patients are often on various types of drugs interfering with coagulation and care should be taken to assure sufficient coagulation ability when neuraxial blocks are applied. Peri-operative goal-directed therapy Goal-directed therapy aims to optimize cardiovascular performance in order to achieve normal or even supranormal oxygen delivery to tissues by optimizing preload and inotropic function using predefined haemodynamic goals. Goal-directed therapy is based on flow or fluid responsiveness of haemodynamic variables, such as stroke volume, response to fluid challenges, stroke volume or pulse pressure variation, or similar cardiac output optimization. Early goal-directed fluid therapy, in the right patient cohort, and with a clearly defined protocol, has been shown to decrease post-operative mortality and morbidity especially in high-risk patients. Risk stratification after surgery Several recent studies demonstrated that it is possible to stratify the risk of post-operative complications and mortality with a simple surgical ‘Apgar’ score. This post-event stratification might allow patient redirection for higher intensity units or for selected post-operative measurements of natriuretic peptides and troponin. Early diagnosis of post-operative complications Post-operative mortality is not solely dependent on the incidence of complications but to the way in which they are managed. The results suggest that early identification of post-operative complications and aggressive management could decrease post-operative morbidity and mortality. Preoperatively and post-operatively, patients that could most benefit from BNP or high-sensitivity troponin measurements are those with METs ≤ 4 or with a revised cardiac risk index value > 1 for vascular surgery and > 2 for non-vascular surgery. Post-operatively, patients with a surgical Apgar score < 7 should also be monitored with BNP or high-sensitivity troponin measurements. Post-operative pain management Severe post-operative pain, reported in 5–10% of patients, increases sympathetic drive and delays recovery. Neuraxial analgesia with local anaesthetics or opioids and/or alpha2-agonists, intravenous opioids alone, or in combination with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs seem to be the most effective regimens. Patient-controlled analgesia has some advantage with regard to patient satisfaction over nurse-controlled or on-demand analgesia. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (especially cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors) increase the risk for cardiovascular events, heart and renal failure as well as thromboembolic events specifically in a high-risk population. These drugs should be avoided in patients with myocardial ischaemia or diffuse atherosclerosis, renal and heart failure, in elderly patients, patients on diuretics, as well as in patients with unstable haemodynamics. Recommendations on anaesthesia   Class a Level b Patients with high cardiac and surgical risk should be considered for goal-directed therapy. IIa B The measurement of natriuretic peptides and high-sensitivity troponin after surgery may be considered in high-risk patients to improve risk stratification. IIb B Neuraxial anaesthesia (alone), in the absence of contra-indications and after estimation of the risk–benefit ratio, reduces the risk of peri-operative mortality and morbidity compared with general anaesthesia and may be considered. IIb B Avoiding arterial hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 60 mmHg) for prolonged cumulative periods (> 30 minutes) may be considered. IIb B Neuraxial analgesia, in the absence of contra-indications, may be considered to provide post-operative analgesia. IIb B Avoiding non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (especially cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors) as the first-line analgesics in patients with IHD or stroke may be considered. IIb B IHD = ischaemic heart disease. a Class of recommendation. b Level of evidence.",

    "text": "1. Diagnosis Clinical probability is the basis of all diagnostic strategies for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) and should systematically be assessed either by clinical judgement or by a validated prediction rule. Plasma D-dimer measurement, preferably using a highly sensitive assay, is recommended in outpatients and in the emergency department to reduce the need for unnecessary imaging and irradiation. A normal computed tomographic (CT) angiography safely excludes PE in patients with low or intermediate clinical probability, or PE-unlikely, while CT angiography showing a segmental or more proximal thrombus confirms PE. A normal perfusion lung scan excludes PE, and a high probability ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan confirms PE; in case of a non-diagnostic V/Q lung scan, PE may be excluded if proximal compression venous ultrasonography (CUS) is negative and the clinical probability is low or PE-unlikely.   2. Prognostic assessment At the stage of clinical suspicion of PE, haemodynamically unstable patients with shock or hypotension should immediately be identified as high-risk patients. Normotensive patients in Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) Class ≥III or a simplified (s)PESI of ≥1 constitute an intermediate-risk group. Of these, patients who have both evidence of RV dysfunction (by echocardiography or CT angiography) and elevated cardiac biomarker levels in the circulation should be classified into an intermediate-high-risk category and monitored for early detection of haemodynamic decompensation. A PESI Class I or II, or a sPESI of 0, indicates a low risk of an early adverse outcome.   3. Acute phase treatment Primary reperfusion treatment, particularly systemic thrombolysis, is the treatment of choice for patients with high-risk PE. Unfractionated heparin with aPTT monitoring is the prefered anticoagulation regimen in such patients For most cases of acute PE without haemodynamic compromise, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux is the initial treatment of choice unless there is severe renal dysfunction. Systemic thrombolysis is not routinely recommended as primary treatment for patients with intermediate-high risk PE, but should be considered if clinical signs of haemodynamic decompensation appear; percutaneous catheter-directed treatment or surgical pulmonary embolectomy are alternative rescue procedures for intermediate-high-risk PE. The new oral anticoagulants (NOACs; direct inhibitors of factor Xa or thrombin) are non-inferior in terms of efficacy and possibly safer, particularly in terms of major bleeding, than the standard anticoagulation regimen consisting of heparin followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). Low-risk patients in the PESI Class I or II, and probably those with sPESI of 0, should be considered for early discharge and outpatient treatment, if this appears feasible based on the patient’s anticipated compliance as well as his/her family and social background.   4. Duration of anticoagulation For patients with unprovoked PE, oral anticoagulation is recommended for at least 3 months. In the extended treatment of VTE, NOACs are both effective (in terms of prevention of symptomatic or fatal VTE recurrence) and safe (particularly in terms of major bleeding), probably safer than standard VKA regimens. In patients who refuse to take or are unable to tolerate any form of oral anticoagulants, aspirin may be considered for extended secondary VTE prophylaxis.   5. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) Organized unresolved thrombi and pulmonary vascular remodelling contribute to progressive right ventricular failure and poor outcome in non-treated CTEPH. Life-long anticoagulation (with VKA and an INR of 2-3) is recommended for all patients with CTEPH. Pulmonary endarterectomy is the treatment of choice for the majority of patients. Pharmacotherapy and pulmonary angioplasty are emerging as treatment alternatives for non-operable patients as well as for those with pulmonary hypertension persisting after intervention.   6. PE in pregnancy Suspicion of PE in pregnancy warrants formal diagnostic assessment with validated methods. A negative D-dimer result has similar clinical significance as in non-pregnant patients. Perfusion lung scan may be considered to rule out suspected PE in pregnant women with a normal chest X-ray. A weight-adjusted dose of LMWH is the recommended therapy during pregnancy in patients without shock or hypotension. NOACs are contraindicated in pregnancy.   7. PE and cancer The risk of VTE in cancer patients is at least four times higher than in the general population and increases further with chemotherapy and surgical treatment. Incidental finding of pulmonary artery thrombi in cancer patients should be managed in the same way as symptomatic pulmonary embolism, particularly if found in segmental or more proximal arteries. For patients with PE and cancer, weight-adjusted subcutaneous LMWH should be considered for the first 3 to 6 months. Extended anticoagulation (beyond the first 3 to 6 months) should be considered for an indefinite period or until the cancer is considered cured.",

    "text": "The diagnostic value and clinical significance of subsegmental defects on CT angiography are still debated. Patients with incidental (unsuspected PE) on CT angiography should probably be treated, especially if they have cancer and a proximal clot, but solid evidence in support of this recommendation is lacking. The benefits versus risks of “triple rule-out” CT angiography (to confirm or exclude coronary artery disease, pulmonary embolism and/or aortic dissection) need thorough evaluation - also considering increased radiation and contrast exposure - given the low prevalence of PE and aortic dissection in published series using that approach. Preliminary results suggest that reduced-dose intravenous thrombolysis may be safe and effective, particularly in intermediate-risk PE, but solid evidence is still lacking. Catheter-directed treatment (e.g. pharmacomechanical thrombolysis) has shown a promising efficacy and (particularly) safety profile, but data from larger study populations are needed to determine whether it will become a widely accepted (and widely available) alternative option to systemic thrombolysis for reperfusion treatment. The results of the phase III trials on the use of new oral anticoagulants in the treatment of PE and secondary prevention of VTE appear convincing; clinical experience with these drugs under ‘real world’ conditions is accumulating. Further management trials are necessary to crystallize the criteria that might permit early discharge and home treatment of low-risk patients with acute PE. The true risk for developing CTEPH after acute PE needs to be determined on the basis of high-quality data. There is lack of data to support the use of riociguat, or the off-label use of drugs approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension, as a therapeutic bridge to pulmonary endarterectomy in CTEPH patients considered to be at high risk due to poor haemodynamics. Advances in balloon pulmonary angioplasty are continuing in an attempt to make this technique a therapeutic alternative for selected patients with non-operable CTEPH. Data on the validity of clinical prediction rules for PE in pregnancy are lacking. The evidence supporting screening for occult cancer after unprovoked VTE is inconclusive. Further data are needed on the treatment of cancer patients with NOACs.",

    "text": "Introduction Epidemiology Venous thromboembolism (VTE) encompasses deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). It is the third most frequent cardiovascular disease with an overall annual incidence of 100–200 per 100 000 inhabitants. Acute PE is the most serious clinical presentation of VTE and a major cause of mortality, morbidity, and hospitalization. As estimated on the basis of an epidemiological model, over 317 000 deaths were related to VTE in six countries of the European Union (with a total population of 454.4 million) in 2004. Of these cases, 34% presented with sudden fatal PE and 59% were deaths resulting from PE that remained undiagnosed during life; only 7% of the patients who died early were correctly diagnosed with PE before death. Since patients older than 40 years are at increased risk compared with younger patients, and the risk approximately doubles with each subsequent decade, an ever larger number of patients are expected to be diagnosed with (and perhaps die of) PE in the future.",

The clinical probability is usually high, and the differential diagnosis includes acute valvular dysfunction, tamponade, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and aortic dissection. The most useful initial test in this situation is bedside transthoracic echocardiography, which will yield evidence of acute pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction if acute PE is the cause of the patient’s haemodynamic decompensation. In a highly unstable patient, echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction is sufficient to prompt immediate reperfusion without further testing.

D-dimer should not be measured in patients with a high clinical probability because of a low negative predictive value in this population. It is also less useful in hospitalized patients because the number needed to test to obtain a clinically relevant negative result is high. In most centres, multidetector computed tomographic (MDCT) angiography is the second-line test in patients with an elevated D-dimer level and the first-line test in patients with a high clinical probability. CT angiography is considered diagnostic of PE when it shows a clot at least at the segmen tal level of the pulmonary arterial tree. Diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected PE in the absence of shock and hypotension CT = computed tomographic; PE = pulmonary embolism. a Two alternative classification schemes may be used for clinical probability assessment, i.e. a three-level scheme (clinical probability defined as low, intermediate, or high) or a two-level scheme (PE unlikely or PE likely). When using a moderately sensitive assay, D-dimer measurement should be restricted to patients with low clinical probability or a PE-unlikely classification, while highly sensitive assays may also be used in patients with intermediate clinical probability of PE.

The plasma levels of natriuretic peptides reflect the severity of RV dysfunction in acute PE. In normotensive patients with PE, the positive predictive value of elevated BNP or NT-proBNP concentrations for early mortality is low. On the other hand, low levels of BNP or NT-proBNP can identify patients with a favourable short-term clinical outcome based on their high negative predictive value. Transmural RV infarction despite patent coronary arteries has been found at autopsy of patients who died of massive PE. Elevated plasma troponin concentrations on admission have been reported in PE and were associated with worse prognosis. Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP), an early marker of myocardial injury, was also found to possess prognostic value in acute PE. Various combinations of clinical findings with imaging and laboratory tests have been proposed and tested in registries and cohort studies in an attempt to improve risk stratification of PE.

    "text": "Acute phase treatment Anticoagulation In patients with acute PE, anticoagulation is recommended with the objective to prevent both early death and recurrent symptomatic or fatal VTE. The standard duration of anticoagulation should cover at least 3 months. Within this period, acute-phase treatment consists of parenteral anticoagulation (unfractionated heparin, LMWH or fondaparinux) administration over the first 5–10 days. Parenteral heparin administration should overlap with the initiation of a vitamin K antagonist (VKA); alternatively, it can be followed by administration of one of the new oral anticoagulants dabigatran or edoxaban. If rivaroxaban or apixaban is given instead, oral treatment with one of these agents should be started directly or after a 1-2 day administration of unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux). In this latter case, acute-phase treatment consists of an increased dose of the oral anticoagulant over the first 3 weeks (for rivaroxaban), or over the first 7 days (for apixaban).

The results of the trials using non-vitamin K-dependent new oral anticoagulants(NOACs) in the treatment of VTE indicate that these agents are non-inferior (in terms of efficacy) and possibly safer (particularly in terms of major bleeding) than the standard heparin/VKA regimen. At the moment of publication of these guidelines, rivaroxaban, dabigatran and apixaban are approved for treatment of VTE in the European Union; edoxaban is currently under regulatory review.

    "text": "Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension Diagnosis Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a debilitating disease caused by chronic obstruction of major pulmonary arteries. Although the exact prevalence and annual incidence of CTEPH is unknown, available data suggest that this condition may occur in approximately 5 individuals per million population per year. Planar V/Q lung scan remains the main first-line imaging modality for CTEPH, as it carries a 96–97% sensitivity and 90–95% specificity for the diagnosis. By contrast, in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH) and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, lung scans show either non-segmental perfusion defects or are normal. CT pulmonary angiography and right heart catheterization are necessary to detect organized thrombi and to confirm precapillary pulmonary hypertension, respectively. Pulmonary angiography should follow to characterize the type and distribution of intraluminal changes. Algorithm for the diagnosis of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension CT = computed tomography (pulmonary angiography and high resolution imaging of the lung for diagnosis of parenchymal lesions); CTEPH = chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; DSA = digital subtraction angiography; Echo = echocardiography; MRA = magnetic resonance angiography; TR = tricuspid regurgitation velocity; V/Q = ventilation-perfusion. a Conventional pulmonary angiography using DSA technique is the gold standard for imaging of the pulmonary vasculature.

    "text": "1. Definition Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is defined by the presence of increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness that is not solely explained by abnormal loading conditions. In an adult, this represents a wall thickness ≥15 mm in one or more LV myocardial segments (or ≥13 mm in a first degree relative of someone with HCM) measured by any imaging technique.   2. Prevalence & Aetiology Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) occurs in 0.02–0.23%of adults, with much lower rates in patients diagnosed under the age of 25 years. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be caused by many genetic and non-genetic disorders. In up to 60% of patients with HCM, the disease is an autosomal dominant trait caused by mutations in cardiac sarcomere protein genes. 5-10% of adult cases are caused by other genetic disorders including inherited metabolic and neuromuscular diseases, chromosome abnormalities and genetic syndromes.   3. Genetic Counselling & Testing Genetic counselling is recommended in all patients with unequivocal HCM when it cannot be explained solely by a non-genetic cause. When a definite causative genetic mutation is identified in a patient, his or her first degree relatives should first be genetically tested. They should undergo clinical evaluation if they are found to carry the same mutation.   4. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction Two-thirds of patients with HCM have dynamic obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOTO) at rest or during exercise caused by contact between the mitral valve and the interventricular septum during systole. In patients with a resting LVOT gradient <50 mmHg bedside physiological provocation with Valsalva manoeuvre and standing should be routinely performed during echocardiography to determine if LV outflow obstruction can be provoked. Exercise stress echocardiography is recommended in symptomatic patients with an LVOT gradient <50 mmHg at rest or during physiological provocation. When a gradient is detected in the LV cavity, the presence of sub-aortic membranes, structural mitral valve leaflet abnormalities and mid-cavity obstruction should be systematically excluded.   5. Assessment of symptoms Most people with HCM are asymptomatic and have a normal life expectancy but somedevelop symptoms, often many years after the first manifestation of ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities. Systematic 2-D and Doppler echcardiography, exercise testing and ambulatory ECG monitoring are usually sufficient to determine the most likely cause of symptoms.   6. Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death While the risk of sudden death is low for most patients with HCM, a small number are prone to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. The use of a new risk calculator (HCMRisk-SCD) (http://doc2do.com/hcm/webHCM.html) is recommended to guide the use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD). In all patients, clinical efficacy of ICD implantation should be balanced against its potential risk.   7. Symptomatic treatment In symptomatic patients with LVOTO, the aim is to reduce dyspnoea and chest pain by using drugs, surgical myectomy, alcohol ablation or pacing. Therapy in symptomatic patients without LVOTO focuses on management of arrhythmias, reduction of LV filling pressures, and treatment of angina. Patients with symptomatic progressive LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction refractory to medical therapy may be candidates for cardiac transplantation.   8. Atrial Arrhythmias Patients with HCM and paroxysmal, persistent or permanent AF should receive treatment with vitamin K antagonists. Lifelong therapy with oral anticoagulants is recommended, even when sinus rhythm is restored. Patients in sinus rhythm with LA diameter ≥45 mm should undergo 6–12 monthly 48-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring to detect AF.   9. Management of Pregnancy Most women with HCM tolerate pregnancy well but require expert advice and monitoring throughout pregnancy. All women with HCM should receive advice on contraception, sterilisation and termination when appropriate.   10. Multidisciplinary Care Clinicians should consider referral of patients to multidisciplinary teams with expertise in the diagnosis, genetics, risk stratification and management of myocardial disease.",

First degree relatives should be provided with information about the consequences of a diagnosis for life insurance, pension, occupation, sporting activities, and eligibility for fostering and adoption before they undergo genetic testing or clinical evaluation. When a definite causative genetic mutation is identified, relatives should be first genetically tested and then clinically evaluated if they are found to carry the same mutation. When genetic testing cannot be performed or fails to identify a definite mutation, first degree relatives should be offered clinical screening with an ECG and echocardiogram which is then repeated every 1-2 years between 10 and 20 years of age and then every 2-5 years thereafter.

    "text": "General lifestyle considerations General lifestyle considerations for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Topic General guidance Exercise Patients with HCM should avoid competitive sports activities, but should maintain a healthy lifestyle. Advice on recreational activities should be tailored to symptoms and the risk of disease-related complications including sudden cardiac death. Diet, alcohol and weight Patients should be encouraged to maintain a healthy body mass index. Large meals can precipitate chest pain, particularly in patients with LVOTO. Smaller, more frequent meals may be helpful. Avoid dehydration and excess alcohol, particularly in patients with LVOTO. Constipation is a frequent side-effect of verapamil/disopyramide and should be managed with diet and if necessary aperients. Smoking There are no data that show an interaction between tobacco smoking and HCM, but patients should be provided with general advice on the health risks associated with smoking and, when available, information on smoking cessation. Sexual activity Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss their concerns about sexual activity. Anxiety and depression following a diagnosis are frequent and some patients may express guilt or fear about their genetic diagnosis and the risk of transmission to offspring. Patients should be counselled on the potential effect of their medication on sexual performance. In general, patients should avoid PDE5 inhibitors, particularly when they have LVOTO. Medication Patients should be provided with information about their medication, including potential side-effects and interactions with prescribed medications, over-the-counter remedies and other complementary therapies. Where possible, peripheral vasodilators should be avoided in patients, particularly when they have LVOTO. Vaccination In the absence of contra-indications, symptomatic patients should be advised to have yearly influenza vaccination. Driving Most patients should be eligible for an ordinary driving licence and can continue driving unless they experience distracting or disabling symptoms. Advice on driving licences for heavy goods or passenger-carrying vehicles should be in line with local legislation. For further advice on driving with ICD see EHRA guidancea and local rules. Occupation Most people with HCM will be able to continue in their normal job. The implications of heavy manual jobs that involve strenuous activity should be discussed with the appropriate specialist. For some occupations such as pilots, and military and emergency services, there are strict guidelines on eligibility. The social and financial implications of a diagnosis of HCM should be included in the counselling of relatives before clinical or genetic screening. Holidays and travel insurance Most asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients can fly safely. For further advice see Fitness to fly for passengers with cardiovascular diseaseb. Insurance companies may charge more for travel insurance. In some countries, patient support organizations can provide further advice about obtaining reasonable insurance. Life insurance The diagnosis of HCM will result in difficulty obtaining life insurance or mortgages. Advice on the rules that apply in different countries should be provided to patients at diagnosis Pregnancy and childbirth Counselling on safe and effective contraception and referral for specialist pre-pregnancy risk assessment is indicated in all women of fertile age. Education/ schooling Teachers and other carers should be provided with advice and written information relevant to the care of children with HCM. In the absence of symptoms and risk factors, children should be allowed to perform low to moderate level aerobic physical activity, in accordance with advice from their cardiologist. Provision should be made for children with learning difficulties and other special needs HCM = hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; LVOTO = left ventricular outflow tract obstruction; PDE5 = phosphodiesterase 5. aVijgen J et al.

    "text": "Resting and ambulatory electrocardiography Standard 12-lead ECG provides useful clues to the diagnosis as well as the distribution of hypertrophy and myocardial scar (Table 4). The ECG is a sensitive although non-specific early marker of disease in relatives. Ambulatory ECG monitoring is recommended at the initial assessment to assess the risk of sudden cardiac death (section 9.6: Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death) and stroke see section on atrial tachyarrhythmia. Table 4 Electrocardiographic abnormalities suggesting specific diagnoses or morphological variants Finding Comment Short PR interval/pre-excitation Pre-excitation is a common feature of storage diseases (Pompe, PRKAG2, and Danon) and mitochondrial disorders (MELAS, MERFF). A short PR interval without pre-excitation is seen in Anderson-Fabry disease. AV block Progressive atrioventricular conduction delay is common in mitochondrial disorders, some storage diseases (including Anderson-Fabry disease), amyloidosis, desminopathies and in patients with PRKAG2 mutations. Extreme LVH (Sokolow score ≥ 50) Extremely large QRS voltage is typical of storage diseases such as Pompe and Danon disease, but can be caused by pre-excitation alone. Low QRS voltage (or normal voltages despite increased LV wall thickness) Low QRS voltage in the absence of pericardial effusion, obesity and lung disease is rare in HCM (limited to cases with end-stage evolution) but is found in up to 50% of patients with AL amyloidosis and 20% with TTR amyloidosis. Differential diagnosis between HCM and cardiac amyloidosis is aided by measuring the ratio between QRS voltages and LV wall thickness. Extreme superior (“North West”) QRS axis deviation Seen in patients with Noonan syndrome who have severe basal hypertrophy extending into the RV outflow tract. Giant negative T wave inversion (> 10 mm) Giant negative T wave inversion in the precordial and/or inferolateral leads suggests involvement of the LV apex. Abnormal Q waves ≥ 40 ms in duration and/or ≥ 25% of the R wave in depth and/or ≥ 3 mm in depth in at least two contiguous leads except aVR Abnormally deep Q waves in the inferolateral leads, usually with a positive T wave, are associated with an asymmetrical distribution of LVH. Q waves of abnormal duration (≥ 40 ms) are associated with areas of replacement fibrosis. Coved ST-segmentelevation in lateral chest leads Some patients with apical or distal hypertrophy develop small apical aneurysms, sometimes associated with myocardial scarring. These may only be detectable on CMR, ventriculography or contrast echo, and are occasionally associated with ST-segment in the lateral chest leads.

LV outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) caused by systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve leaflets occurs at rest in one third of patients and another third during physiological provocation (Valsalva, standing and exercise). LVOTO is defined as an instantaneous peak Doppler LV outflow tract pressure gradient ≥ 30 mmHg at rest or during physiological provocation but is usually clinically significant only when ≥ 50 mmHg. Figure 3 summarises the approach to the assessment of LVOTO in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Obstruction unrelated to SAM, (sub-aortic membranes, mitral valve leaflet abnormalities and mid-cavity obstruction) should be systematically excluded. SAM of the mitral valve nearly always results in mid to late systolic and inferolaterally oriented mitral regurgitation. The presence of a central or anteriorly directed jet should prompt further assessment of the mitral valve.

    "text": "Implantable cardioverter defibrillators ICD implantation should be considered in patients who have survived a cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation or experienced spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia causing haemodynamic compromise. All other patients should undergo a standardized clinical evaluation that records a predefined set of prognostic variables which are then used to estimate the 5-year risk of SCD using the HCM Risk-SCD model (see figure 7): Probability SCD at 5 years = 1 – 0.998 exp(prognostic index) where Prognostic index = [0.15939858 x maximal wall thickness (mm)] – [0.00294271 x maximal wall thickness2 (mm2)] + [0.0259082 x left atrial diameter (mm)] + [0.00446131 x maximal (rest/Valsalva) left ventricular outflow tract gradient (mmHg)] + [0.4583082 x family history SCD] + [0.82639195 x NSVT] + [0.71650361 x unexplained syncope] – [0.01799934 x age at clinical evaluation (years)]. Nota bene: In HCM Risk-SCD there was a non-linear relation between the risk of SCD and maximum left ventricular wall thickness. This is accounted for in the risk prediction model by the inclusion of a quadratic term for maximum left ventricular wall thickness. HCM Risk-SCD should NOT be used in patients < 16 years of age, elite athletes or in individuals with metabolic/infiltrative diseases (e.g. Anderson-Fabry disease) and syndromes (e.g. Noonan syndrome). The model does not use exercise induced left ventricular outflow tract gradients and has not been validated before and after myectomy or alcohol septal ablation. Pending further studies, HCM Risk-SCD should be used cautiously in patients with a maximum thickness ≥ 35 mm. Decisions on ICD therapy should always consider the age and general health of the patient, socio-economic factors and the psychological impact of therapy. In patients with clinical features not included in HCM Risk-SCD, therapy should be individualised and balance the likely benefit against the lifelong risk of complications. Recommendations on prevention of sudden cardiac death Classa Levelb Avoidance of competitive sports c is recommended in patients with HCM. I C ICD implantation is recommended in patients who have survived a cardiac arrest due to VT or VF, or who have spontaneous sustained VT causing syncope or haemodynamic compromise, and have a life expectancy of > 1 year. I B HCM Risk-SCD is recommended as a method for estimating risk of sudden death at 5 years in patients aged ≥ 16 years without a history of resuscitated VT/VF or spontaneous sustained VT causing syncope or haemodynamic compromise. I B It is recommended that the 5-year risk of SCD be assessed at first evaluation and re-evaluated at 1–2 yearly intervals or whenever there is a change in clinical status. I B ICD implantation should be considered in patients with an estimated, 5-year risk of sudden death of ≥ 6% and a life expectancy of > 1 year, following detailed clinical assessment that takes into account the lifelong risk of complications and the impact of an ICD on lifestyle, socio-economic status and psychological health. IIa B ICD implantation may be considered in individual patients with an estimated 5-year risk of SCD of between ≥ 4% and < 6% and a life expectancy of > 1 year following detailed clinical assessment that takes into account the lifelong risk of complications and the impact of an ICD on lifestyle, socio-economic status and psychological health. IIb B ICD implantation may be considered in individual patients with an estimated 5-year risk of SCD of < 4% only when they have clinical features that are of proven prognostic importance, and when an assessment of the lifelong risk of complications and the impact of an ICD on lifestyle, socio-economic status and psychological health suggests a net benefit from ICD therapy.

Advice on recreational activities should be tailored to symptoms and the risk of disease-related complications including sudden cardiac death. Diet, alcohol and weight Patients should be encouraged to maintain a healthy body mass index. Large meals can precipitate chest pain, particularly in patients with LVOTO. Smaller, more frequent meals may be helpful. Avoid dehydration and excess alcohol, particularly in patients with LVOTO. Constipation is a frequent side-effect of verapamil/disopyramide and should be managed with diet and if necessary aperients. Smoking There are no data that show an interaction between tobacco smoking and HCM, but patients should be provided with general advice on the health risks associated with smoking and, when available, information on smoking cessation. Sexual activity Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss their concerns about sexual activity. Anxiety and depression following a diagnosis are frequent and some patients may express guilt or fear about their genetic diagnosis and the risk of transmission to offspring. Patients should be counselled on the potential effect of their medication on sexual performance. In general, patients should avoid PDE5 inhibitors, particularly when they have LVOTO. Medication Patients should be provided with information about their medication, including potential side-effects and interactions with prescribed medications, over-the-counter remedies and other complementary therapies. Where possible, peripheral vasodilators should be avoided in patients, particularly when they have LVOTO. Vaccination In the absence of contra-indications, symptomatic patients should be advised to have yearly influenza vaccination. Driving Most patients should be eligible for an ordinary driving licence and can continue driving unless they experience distracting or disabling symptoms. Advice on driving licences for heavy goods or passenger-carrying vehicles should be in line with local legislation. For further advice on driving with ICD see EHRA guidance a and local rules. Occupation Most people with HCM will be able to continue in their normal job. The implications of heavy manual jobs that involve strenuous activity should be discussed with the appropriate specialist. For some occupations such as pilots, and military and services, there are strict guidelines on eligibility. The social and financial implications of a diagnosis of HCM should be included in the counselling of relatives before clinical or genetic screening. Holidays and travel insurance Most asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients can fly safely. For further advice see Fitness to fly for passengers with cardiovascular disease b. Insurance companies may charge more for travel insurance. In some countries, patient support organizations can provide further advice about obtaining reasonable insurance. Life insurance The diagnosis of HCM will result in difficulty obtaining life insurance or mortgages. Advice on the rules that apply in different countries should be provided to patients at diagnosis. Pregnancy and childbirth See section Reproduction and contraception. Education/schooling Teachers and other carers should be provided with advice and written information relevant to the care of children with HCM. In the absence of symptoms and risk factors, children should be allowed to perform low to moderate level aerobic physical activity, in accordance with advice from their cardiologist. Provision should be made for children with learning difficulties and other special needs.

    "text": "1. The holistic view to the aorta as “whole organ” The guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of aortic diseases highlight the value of a holistic approach, viewing the aorta as the whole organ; indeed, in many cases tandem lesions of the aorta may exist, as illustrated by the increased probability of thoracic aortic aneurysm in the case of abdominal aortic aneurysm, making a distinction between the two regions inadequate. In addition thorako-abdominal aortic diseases are overwriting this separation.   2. Diagnostic Imaging Whereas a clinical examination and laboratory testing play a minor role in the diagnosis and treatment of aortic diseases, imaging techniques, particularly modern images techniques, play a major role yielding a view of the total aorta, which requires standardized reports and measurements at given landmarks. Comparison of methods for imaging the aorta Advantages/​disadvantages TTE TOE CTc MRIc Aortography Ease of use +++ ++ +++ ++ + Diagnostic reliability + +++ +++ +++ ++ Bedside/​interventional usea ++ ++ – – ++ Serial examinations ++ + ++(+)b +++ – Aortic wall visualizationc + +++ +++ +++ – Cost – – – – – – – – – – Radiation 0 0 – – – – – – Nephrotoxicity 0 0 – – – – – – – – CT = computed tomography; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; TOE = transoesophageal echocardiography; TTE = transthoracic echocardiography. + means a positive aspect and – means a negative point.

It is recommended to measure diameters at anatomical landmarks perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. In case of repetitive imaging of the aorta the imaging should be used, with the lowest iatrogenic risk. In addition, it is recommended to use the same imaging modality with the similar method of measurement. All relevant parameters are recommended to be reported recording to the aortic segmentation. It is recommended to assess renal function, pregnancy and history of allergy to contrast agents in order to select the optimal imaging modality with minimal radiation exposure. Complete list of normal values for all discussed imaging techniques are found in the Full Text and Web Addenda.   3. The acute aortic syndrome Acute aortic syndromes (AAS) are defined as emergency conditions with similar clinical characteristics involving the aorta: aortic dissection, intramural haematoma, penetrating aortic ulcer, complete rupture of the aorta, traumatic aortic injury, iatrogenic aortic dissection. A flowchart for the emergency room has been developed in order to enhance the standardization of decision making in acute aortic syndromes, because survival is strongly related to time. In the diagnostic work-up clinical data are useful to assess the priori probability of AAS including the high-risk patient conditions, high-risk pain features and signs of high-risk examination features. High-risk conditions Marfan syndrome (or other connective tissue diseases) Family history of aortic disease Known aortic valve disease Known thoracic aortic aneurysm Previous aortic manipulation (including cardiac surgery) High-risk pain features Chest, back, or abdominal pain described as any of the following: abrupt onset severe intensity ripping or tearing High-risk examination features Evidence of perfusion deficit: pulse deficit systolic blood pressure difference focal neurological deficit (in conjunction with pain) Aortic diastolic murmur (new and with pain) Hypotension or shock Risk score varies from 0–3 according the number of positive categories (1 point per column). Table modified from Rogers AM et al Circulation 2011;123:2213-8.   Based on the probability of acute aortic syndromes the decision making can be based according to developed flow-chart.   Flowchart for decision-making based on pretest sensitivity of AAS AAS = acute aortic syndrome; AD = aortic dissection; ESC = European Society of Cardiology; CT = computed tomography; ECG = electrocardiogram; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; STEMI = ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; TTE = transthoracic echocardiography; TOE = transoesophageal echocardiography. aSTEMI can be associated with AAS in rare cases. - bPending local availability, patient characteristics, and physician experience. cProof of Type A AD by the presence of flap, aortic regurgitation, and/or pericardial effusion. - dPreferably point-of-care, otherwise classical. eAlso troponin to detect non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.   4. Treatment of acute aortic syndrome 4.1 Medical management A lot of patients with aortic diseases have comorbidities such as coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and others. Therefore treatment and prevention strategies have to be similar to those indicated for the above diseases. Specific treatments in different aortic diseases are addressed in each specific chapter.   4.2 (Thoracic) endovascular aortic repair ((T)EVAR) It is recommended to decide the indication of endovascular repair on individual basis according to anatomy, pathology, comorbidity and anticipated durability, of any repair using multidisciplinary approach (Class I C). A sufficient proximal and distal landing zone of at least 2 cm is recommended for the safe deployment and durable fixation of TEVAR (Class I C). In case of aortic aneurysm it is recommended to select a stent-graft with a diameter exceeding the diameter of the landing zones by at least 10-15% of the reference aorta (Class I C). During stent graft placement, invasive blood pressure monitoring and control either pharmacologically or by rapid pacing is recommended (Class I C). For complicated type B aortic dissection, TEVAR is recommended (Class I C). If the anatomy is suitable and the expertise available endovascular repair should be preferred over open surgery in contained rupture of thoracic aortic aneurysm (Class I C). For uncomplicated type B aortic dissection endovascular therapy should be considered (Class IIa B) as well as in complicated type B intramural haematoma, complicated type B penetrating aortic ulcer and traumatic aortic injury (Class IIa C)   4.3 Surgery in acute aortic syndrome In patient with type A aortic dissection urgent surgery is recommended (Class I B). Surgery is also indicated in typ A intramural haematoma (Class I C). In case of type B penetrating aortic ulcer, surgery should be considered (Class IIa C). For complicated type B aortic dissection, intramural haematoma and penetrating aortic ulcer surgery may be considered (Class IIb C).   5. Aortic aneuryms When an aortic aneurysm is identified at any location, assessment of the entire aorta and aortic valve is recommended at baseline and during follow-up (Class I C). In case of aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, duplex ultrasound for screening of peripheral artery disease and peripheral aneurysms should be considered (Class IIa C). Patients with aortic aneurysms are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, general principles of cardiovascular prevention should be considered (Class IIa C).   5.1 Indication for intervention for ascending and arch aortic aneuryms Surgery is indicated in patients who have aortic root aneurysms with maximal aortic diameter ≥50 mm for patients with Marfan syndrome (Class I C). Surgery should be considered in patients who have aortic root aneurysm with maximal ascending aortic diameter: ≥45 mm for patients with Marfan syndromes with risk factors (family history of aortic dissection and/or aortic diameter increase >3 mm/year ≥50 mm for patients with bicuspid valve with risk factors ≥55 mm for patients with no elastopathy (Class IIa C). Surgery should be considered in patients who have isolated aortic arch aneurysm with maximal diameter ≥55 mm (Class IIa C). Lower levels thresholds for intervention may be considered according to body surface area in patients of small stature or in case of rapid progression, aortic valve regurgitation, planned pregnancy, and patients preference (Class IIb C). Aortic arch repair may be considered in patient with aortic arch aneurysm who already have an indication for surgery of an adjacent aneurysm located in the ascending aorta or descending aorta (Class IIb C).   5.2 Intervention for descending aortic aneurysms Valvular problems associated with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) are covered in the 2012 ESC/EACTS guidelines on management of valvular diseases (European Heart J 2012;33:2451-2496).   6. Abdominal aortic aneurysm Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) have a prevalence of about 2% and are particularly found in men >65 years and women who are smoking >65 years. Aortic AAA are usually asymptomatic until rupture occurs. The aortic diameter relates to risks of rupture. As a screening tool ultrasound is recommended in all men >65 years (Class I A) and considered in women >65 years and tobacco smoking (Class IIb C). Very new is the advice, to use a 2 minutes extra time during TTE to check for existence of an asymptomatic AAA in men >65 years (Class IIa B) and women >65 years who are smoking (Class IIb C). Target screening should be considered in first degree siblings of AAA patients (Class IIa B). Please check 2014 ESC/ESA Guidelines on non-cardiac surgery for cardiovascular risk assessment and management (European Heart J 2014:35:2383-2431). Additional information concerning reduction of cardiac risk in case of intervention and surgery are given.   6.1 Endovascular aortic repair and open vascular surgery About 60% of all AAA are suitable for endovascular therapy. In randomized controlled studies endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) reduced mortality threshold. But long-term result were similar due to high re-intervention rates. Smoking cessation is recommended to slow the AAA growth (Class I B). AAA repair is indicated if AAA diameter exceeds 55 mm (Class I B). If the anatomy is suitable for EVAR, either open or endovascular aortic repair is recommended (Class I A). If the aneurysm is anatomically not suitable for EVAR, open endovascular aortic surgery is recommended (Class I C). 6.2 Management of symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms In case of rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms two randomized controlled trials are available demonstrating similar 30 days mortality results (30.4% versus 37.4%). Based on these results following recommendations are given. In suspected ruptured AAA, immediate abdominal ultrasound is recommended (Class I C). In case of rupture, AAA emergency repair is indicated (Class I C). In case of symptomatic but non rupture AAA, urgent repair is indicated (Class I C). In case of symptomatic AAA anatomical suitable for EVAR, either open or endovascular repair is recommended (Class I A).   7. Long-term follow-up for chronic aortic dissection Contrast CT or MRI is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of chronic aortic dissection (Class I C). Close imaging surveillance in aortic dissection is indicated to detect signs of complications (Class I C). In patients with chronic aortic dissection, tight blood pressure control (> 130/80 mmHg) is indicated (Class I C). After TEVAR or EVAR surveillance is recommended after 1 month, 6 months, 12 months and then yearly (Class I C). CT is recommended as the first choice imaging technique for follow-up after TEVAR or EVAR (Class I C). In AAA Doppler ultrasound with or without contrast agents should be considered for annual postoperative surveillance, with non-contrast CT imaging over 5 years (Class IIa C). For follow-up in young patients MRI should be preferred to CT for imaging magnetic resonance-compatible stent grafts (Class IIa C).   8. Genetic diseases affording the aorta Chromosomal and inherited syndromic thoracic aneurysms During the last years more insight into chromosomal aortic diseases have been given not only for the Marfan syndrome, but also for the Loeys-Dietz syndrome, the Turner syndrome, the Ehlers Danlos syndrome Typ IV, non syndromic familiar aortic aneurysms and even aneurysms – osteoarthritis syndrome and arterial tortuosity syndrome. It is recommended to investigate first degree relatives (siblings and parents) of a subject with thoracic aortic disease to indentify a familiar form in which relatives all have a 50% chance of carrying the familiar mutation-disease (Class I C). Once a familial form of thoracic acute aortic dissection (TAAD) is highly suspected, it is recommended to refer the patient to geneticist for family investigation and molecular testing (Class I C). Variable of age of oncet warrants screening every 5 years of “healthy” at-risk relatives until diagnosis (clinical or molecular) is established or ruled out (Class I C). In familial non syndromic TAAD, screening for aneurysm should be considered not only in the thoracic aorta, but also throughout the arterial tree (including cerebral arteries) (Class IIa C).   8.1 Medical therapy in genetic diseases • In Marfan syndrome beta-blockers are prescribed to reduce the progression rate. • Angiotensin 2 receptor blockers demonstrated attenuation of the dilatation rate of aortic aneurysms. • In Ehlers-Danlos syndrome beta-blockers reduce arterial complications. • No specific data are available for other genetic diseases.   9. Management of bicuspid aortic valve BAV have a prevalence of about 1%. Fusion of the right and left coronary cusp or fusion of the right and none coronary cusp or found combined with normal size aorta, supra-coronary dilatation or cylindric aortic shape. The maximal aortic dilatation rate does not differ for bicuspid aortic valve and Marfan syndrome and is maximal in the tubular aorta (0.42 ± 0.6 and 0.49 ± 0.5 mm/year). BAV have a high heritability with about one quarter with bicuspid aortic valve found in the first degree relatives. The aortic root dilatation is found in about one third in first degree relatives. In case of BAV, surgery is indicated when the aortic root or thoracic aorta diameter is >55 mm, >50 mm in presence of other risk factors, >45 mm when surgical aortic valve replacement is scheduled (Class I C). Because of the familial occurence screening of first degree relatives should be considered (Class IIa C).   10. Future developments The installation of hybrid rooms have been shown to be pacemakers for the development of new diagnostic and treatment options like thoracic endovascular aortic repair, debranching or aortic arch surgery, and the frozen elephant trunk. This can lead in the future to further paradigma changes in the diagnosis and treatment of aortic diseases. It is time to form aortic teams and centers in order to provide full access to experts in the field of cardiology, radiology, pediatric cardiology, genetics, aortic and cardiovascular surgery, which is needed not only for the acute but also for the intense follow-up of patients with aortic diseases.",

Thus, 80% are consensus decision. We need more epidemiological data on acute aortic syndrome in Europe. More evidence needed on the caseload-outcome relationship in the field aortic diseases. The implantation and efficacy of aortic centers in Europe should be assessed.

    "text": "4. Introduction Aortic diseases contribute to the wide spectrum of arterial diseases: aneurysms, acute aortic syndromes (AAS) including aortic dissection (AD), intramural haematoma (IMH), penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) and traumatic aortic injury (TAI), pseudoaneurysm, aortic rupture, atherosclerotic and inflammatory affections, as well as genetic (e.g. Marfan syndrome) and congenital (e.g. coarctation) diseases. Assessment of the aorta is mainly based on imaging techniques: ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Endovascular therapies are playing an increasingly important role in the treatment of aortic diseases, while surgery remains necessary in many situations. Importantly, this document highlights the value of a holistic approach, viewing the aorta as a ‘whole organ’. Indeed, in many cases (e.g. genetic disorders) tandem lesions of the aorta may exist, as illustrated by the increased probability of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) in the case of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), making the distinction between the two regions – with TAAs managed in the past by ‘cardiovascular surgeons’ and AAAs by ‘vascular surgeons’ – arbitrary, although this differentiation may exist in academic terms. These guidelines are the result of a close collaboration between physicians from many different areas of expertise: cardiology, radiology, cardiac and vascular surgery, and genetics. We worked together with the aim of providing the medical community with a guide for rapid diagnosis and decision-making in aortic diseases. In the future, treatment of such patients should at best be concentrated in ‘aorta clinics’, with the involvement of a multidisciplinary team, to ensure the optimal clinical decisions are made for each individual, especially during the chronic phases of the disease.",

    "text": "5. The normal and the ageing aorta The aorta is the ultimate conductance vessel, carrying, almost 200 million litres of blood to the body during lifetime. In addition to the conduit function (Figure 1), the aorta plays an important role in the control of systemic vascular resistance and heart rate via pressure-responsive receptors located in the ascending aorta and aortic arch. The aorta has the role of a ‘second pump’ (Windkessel function) during diastole, which is of utmost importance for (but not only) coronary perfusion. In healthy adults, aortic diameters do not usually exceed 40 mm and taper gradually downstream. They are variably influenced by several factors including age, gender, body size and blood pressure. The upper limit (99th percentile) values of the aortic root are 40mm in men and 34 mm in women. The rate of aortic expansion is about 0.9 mm in men and 0.7 mm in women for each decade of life.

Constant or intermittent abdominal pain or discomfort, a pulsating feeling in the abdomen, or feeling of fullness after minimal food intake in large AAAs. Stroke, transient ischaemic attack, or claudication secondary to aortic atherosclerosis. Hoarseness due to left laryngeal nerve palsy in rapidly progressing lesions.",

Although transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is not the technique of choice for full assessment of the aorta, it is useful for the diagnosis and followup of some aortic segments. TTE is the most frequent technique to measure proximal aortic segments in clinical practice. The aortic root is visualized in the parasternal long-axis and modified apical five-chamber views; however, in these views the aortic walls are seen with suboptimal lateral resolution (Figure 2). TTE or even better TOE also permits assessment of the aortic valve, which is often involved in diseases of the ascending aorta (Figure 3). Of paramount importance for evaluation of the thoracic aorta is the suprasternal view. Abdominal ultrasound (Figure 4) remains the mainstay imaging modality for abdominal aortic diseases because of its ability to measure accurately the aortic size, to detect wall lesions such as mural thrombus or plaques, and because of its wide availability, painlessness, and low cost. CT plays a central role in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of aortic diseases. Its advantages over other imaging modalities include the short time required for image acquisition and processing, the ability to obtain a complete three dimensional (3-D) dataset of the entire aorta, and its large availability (Figure 5). Standardized measurements will help to better assess changes in aortic size over time and avoid erroneous findings of arterial growth. Meticulous side-by-side comparisons and measurements of serial examinations (preferably using the same imaging technique and method) are crucial to exclude random error. Reliable detection of aortic diameter at the same aortic segment over time requires standardized measurement. Diastolic images give the best reproducibility. There is no consensus for any technique on whether the aortic wall should be included or excluded in the aortic diameter measurements, although the difference may be large, depending, for instance, on the amount of thrombotic lining of the arterial wall. Recent prognostic data (especially for AAAs) are derived from measurements where the wall is included in diameter determinations.",

Pulse wave velocity is calculated as the distance travelled by the pulse wave divided by the time taken to travel the distance. Increased arterial stiffness results in increased speed of the pulse wave in the artery. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity is the gold standard for measuring aortic stiffness given its simplicity, accuracy, reproducibility, and strong predictive value for adverse outcomes.

    "text": "7.3. Surgery 7.3.1 Introduction The main principle of surgery for ascending aortic aneurysms is to prevent the risk of dissection or rupture by restoring the normal dimension of the ascending aorta. If the aneurysm extends proximally below the sinotubular junction and one or more aortic sinuses are dilated, the surgical repair is guided by the extent of involvement of the aortic annulus and valve (Figure 7). Several procedures and techniques have significantly lowered the inherent risk of aortic arch surgery, both for aneurysms and aortic dissections (Figures 8 and 9). The surgical approach to the descending aorta is a left thoracotomy between the fourth and seventh intercostal spaces depending on the extension of the aortic pathology (Figure 10). Established methods for operation of the descending aorta include the left heart bypass technique, partial bypass, and operation in deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. When the disease affects both the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta, the surgical approach is a left thoracotomy extended to paramedian laparotomy (Figures 10 and 11). The risk of paraplegia after thoracoabdominal repair is in the range of 6–8%, and procedural as well as systemic measures are beneficial to prevent this disastrous complication. Open abdominal aortic repair usually involves a standard median laparotomy, but may also be performed through a left retroperitoneal approach.

Patients with TAA are most often asymptomatic, detected following thoracic imaging either for other reasons or for screening purpose. The usefulness of screening patients at risk is well recognized in the Marfan syndrome. It can also be considered in first-degree relatives of patients with a BAV. TAA is less frequently revealed by clinical signs (chest pain, aortic valve murmur, compression) or during a complication. Aortic aneurysm size is a key factor for decision. The risk of dissection or rupture increases sharply when the aortic diameter exceeds 60 mm for the ascending and 70 mm for the descending aorta. The presence of other risk factors may contribute to decide earlier intervention.

    "text": "9.3 Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) 9.3.1 Overview AAA, mostly exclusively infrarenal, is usually defined as a diameter ≥ 30 mm. The main aetiology is degenerative. Age, male gender, smoking, hypertension and the presence of atherosclerotic disease, are all associated with the presence of AAA. A family history of AAA is a powerful predictor of prevalent AAA: the risk of AAA increases exponentially with the number of siblings affected. Before its cataclysmic presentation when ruptured, AAA is mostly silent. The most frequent mode of detection is incidental. The pre-operative assessment of AAAs includes the measurement of the maximal perpendicular diameter and its relation with the renal arteries (Figure 15). Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of early mortality after surgery for AAA. Open repair of AAA is associated with a high risk (> 5%) for peri-operative cardiovascular complications. Endovascular AAA repair procedures carry a lower risk (1–5%) compared with open surgery. The need for pre-operative risk stratification before repair of AAA depends on the risk of the procedure (i.e. open vs. endovascular repair) and clinical patient-specific risk factors. More detailed description of risk stratification algorithms are recently updated ESC guidelines.

It visualizes kinks and tortuosities and is useful for planning interventional procedures.

C) Axial cross-section with several accepted methods for measuring the aneurysm diameter: (a) anteroposterior diameter; (b) transverse diameter; (c) maximum short-axis diameter (major axis); and (d) minimal short-axis diameter (minor axis). However, measurement of maximum aneurysm diameter should be performed perpendicular to the vessel centreline (D) rather than on axial cross-sections (particularly in tortuous aneurysms) to avoid overestimation of maximum diameter, as shown in (C). In this example, maximum diameter on axial cross-section (c in C) is 64.2 mm, while the true maximum diameter is 60.5 mm (c in D). In partially thrombosed aneurysms, it is important to measure up to the outer contour of the aneurysm (C and D).

Intimal sarcomas, the most common, are derived from endothelial cells (angiosarcoma) or from myofibroblasts. Leiosarcomas and fibrosarcomas originate from the media or adventitia of the aortic wall. The most characteristic and frequently reported clinical presentation of an intimal angiosarcoma of the aorta is the embolic occlusion of the mesenteric or peripheral artery. Based on reported cases, the recommended therapy involves en bloc resection of the tumour-involved portion of the aorta with negative surgical margins, followed by graft interposition. However, owing to the late diagnosis, frequently at a stage already complicated by the presence of metastases, the location of the aortic lesion, or the presence of comorbidities, this intervention is mostly unfeasible. Other approaches can be endarterectomy or endovascular grafting of the involved segment of the aorta. Adjuvant or palliative chemotherapy and radiation have been proposed in selected cases.",

Long-term follow-up of aortic diseases 14.1 Overview Patients with aortic disease usually require life-long surveillance, independent of the initial treatment strategy (medical, interventional, or surgical). This surveillance consists of clinical evaluation, reassessment of patient’s medical therapies and treatment goals, as well as imaging of the aorta. This section includes the chronic phase of aortic dissection after discharge and as well as specific aspects of followup in patients who took benefit from an aortic intervention.",

    "text": "14.2 Chronic aortic dissection The time course of aortic dissection is divided into acute (≤14 days), subacute (15–90 days), and chronic (>90 days) phases. Chronic aortic dissection can either be uncomplicated with a stable disease course or complicated by progressive aneurysmal degeneration, chronic visceral or limb malperfusion, and persisting or recurrent pain or even rupture. Patients with chronic aortic dissection also include those previously operated for type-A aortic dissection, with persisting dissection of the descending aorta. Two clinical patterns should be distinguished: patients with initially acute aortic dissection entering the chronic phase of the disease and those in whom first diagnosis of chronic aortic dissection is made. Patients with newly diagnosed chronic aortic dissection are often asymptomatic. The lesion is found incidentally. Diagnosis has to be confirmed by cross-sectional imaging such as contrast-enhanced CT, TOE, or MRI. Chronicity of aortic dissection is suggested by imaging characteristics: thickened, immobile intimal flap, presence of thrombus in the FL, or aneurysms of the thoracic aorta secondary to chronic aortic dissection, mostly developed in the distal aortic arch. In symptomatic patients, signs of (contained) rupture such as mediastinal haematoma or pleural effusion may be present.",

    "text": "14.3 Follow-up after thoracic aortic intervention For patients undergoing TEVAR or surgical thoracic aortic repair, first follow-up should be performed 1 month after the treatment to exclude the presence of early complications. Surveillance should be repeated after 6 months, 12 months, and then yearly. For patients primarily receiving medical therapy, surveillance should be performed 6 months after initial diagnosis. For imaging follow-up after TEVAR, CT is the modality of choice. To avoid radiation, MRI may be more widely used in the future, but is not compatible with stainless steel endografts due to large artefacts. MRI can be safely performed for surveillance of nitinol-based stent-grafts; however, it lacks visualization of metallic stent struts and should thus be supplemented by chest X-ray to detect structural disintegration of the metallic stent skeleton. TOE – in combination with chest X-ray – may be used in patients with severe renal dysfunction unable to undergo CT or MRI. After aortic surgery less strict imaging intervals may be sufficient if a stable course has been documented over the first year following surgery.",

Postoperative surveillance of open aortic repair may be considered in 5-yearly intervals after open AAA repair to investigate for para-anastomotic aortic aneurysm using colour Doppler ultrasound or CT imaging. Also, patients with AAA appear to have a relatively high risk for incisional hernia. Recommendations for follow-up and management of chronic aortic diseases   Class a Level b Chronic aortic dissection Contrast CT or MRI is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of chronic aortic dissection. I C Initial close imaging surveillance of patients with chronic aortic dissection is indicated to detect signs of complications as soon as possible. I C In asymptomatic patients with chronic dissection of the ascending aorta, elective surgery should be considered. c IIa C In patients with chronic aortic dissection, tight blood pressure control < 130/80 is indicated. I C Surgery repair or TEVAR is recommended for complicated type-B aortic dissection (aortic diameter > 60 mm, > 10 mm/year growth, malperfusion, recurrent pain). I C Follow-up after endovascular treatment for aortic diseases After TEVAR or EVAR, surveillance is recommended after 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and then yearly. Shorter intervals can be proposed in the event of abnormal findings requiring closer surveillance. I C CT is recommended as the first-choice imaging technique forfollow-up after TEVAR or EVAR. I C If neither endoleak nor AAA sac enlargement is documented during first year after EVAR, colour DUS, with or without contrast agents, should be considered for annual postoperative surveillance, with non-contrast CT imaging every 5 years. IIa C For patients with TAA < 45 mm, annual imaging is recommended; while inpatients with TAA ≥ 45 mm and < 55 mm, imaging every 6 months is recommended, unless the stability of the lesions is evidenced after serial imaging. I C For follow-up after (T)EVAR in young patients, MRI should be preferred to CT for magnetic resonance-compatible stent grafts, to reduce radiation. IIa C Long-term surveillance of open abdominal aortic repair may be considered at loose (5-year) intervals using colour DUS or CT imaging. IIb C AAA = abdominal aortic aneurysm; CT = computed tomography; DUS = duplex ultrasonography; EVAR = endovascular aortic repair; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; TAA = thoracic aortic aneurysm; TEVAR = thoracic endovascular aortic repair. a Class of recommendation - b Level of evidence -  c Pending comorbidities and peri-operative risk.",

    "text": "Introduction Infective endocarditis (IE) is a deadly disease. Despite improvements in its management, IE remains associated with high mortality and severe complications. The 2009 ESC Guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of IE introduced several innovative concepts, including limitation of antibiotic prophylaxis to highest risk patients, focus on healthcare-associated IE and identification of the optimal timing for surgery. However, the publication of new large series of IE studies, including the first randomized study regarding surgical therapy, the important improvement in imaging procedures, particularly in the field of nuclear imaging, and the discrepancies between the previous guidelines, justified the decision of the ESC to update the 2009 guidelines. In addition, the need for a collaborative approach, involving primary care physicians, cardiologists, surgeons, microbiologists, infectious disease specialists, and frequently other specialists, namely the ‘Endocarditis Team’, has been recently underlined, and is developed in these new guidelines.

This multidisciplinary approach has already been shown to be useful in the management of valve disease (the ‘Heart Valve Clinic’), and has been shown to significantly reduce the 1-year mortality in infective endocarditis. Characteristics of the ‘Endocarditis Team’ When to refer a patient with IE to an ‘Endocarditis Team’ in a reference centre Patients with complicated IE, i.e. endocarditis with HF, abscess, or embolic or neurological complication or CHD, should be referred early and managed in a reference centre with immediate surgical facilities. Patients with non-complicated IE can be initially managed in a non-reference centre, but with regular communication with the reference centre, consultations with the multidisciplinary ‘Endocarditis Team’ and, when needed, with external visit to the reference centre. Characteristics of the reference centre Immediate access to diagnostic procedures should be possible, including TTE, TOE, multislice CT, MRI, and nuclear imaging. Immediate access to cardiac surgery should be possible during the early stage of the disease, particularly in case of complicated IE (HF, abscess, large vegetation, neurological, and embolic complications). Several specialists should be present on site (the ‘Endocarditis Team’), including at least cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, anaesthesiologists, ID specialists, microbiologists and, when available, specialists in valve diseases, CHD, pacemaker extraction, echocardiography and other cardiac imaging techniques, neurologists, and facilities for neurosurgery and interventional neuroradiology. Role of the ‘Endocarditis Team’ The ‘Endocarditis Team’ should have meetings on a regular basis in order to discuss cases, take surgical decisions, and define the type of follow-up. The ‘Endocarditis Team’ chooses the type, duration, and mode of follow-up of antibiotic therapy, according to a standardized protocol, following the current guidelines. The ‘Endocarditis Team’ should participate in national or international registries, publicly report the mortality and morbidity of their centre, and be involved in a quality improvement programme, as well as in a patient education programme. The follow-up should be organized on an outpatient visit basis at a frequency depending on the patient’s clinical status (ideally at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after hospital discharge, since the majority of events occur during this period).

The indications and pattern of use of aminoglycosides have changed.

    "text": "Complications and management of IE Introduction Surgical treatment is used in approximately half of patients with IE because of severe complications. Early consultation with a cardiac surgeon is recommended in order to determine the best therapeutic approach. Identification of patients requiring early surgery is frequently difficult and is an important scope of the ‘Endocarditis Team’. In some cases, surgery needs to be performed on an emergency basis (within 24 h), urgent basis (within a few days, <7 days), irrespective of the duration of antibiotic treatment. In other cases, surgery can be postponed to allow 1 or 2 weeks of antibiotic treatment under careful clinical and echocardiographic observation before an elective surgical procedure is performed. The three main indications for early surgery in IE are its 3 main complications, i.e. HF, uncontrolled infection, and prevention of embolic events.",

    "text": "Neurological complications Symptomatic neurological events develop in 15–30% of all patients with IE and additional silent events are frequent. Stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic) is associated with excess mortality. Rapid diagnosis and initiation of appropriate antibiotics are of major importance to prevent a first or recurrent neurological complication. After a first neurological event, if cerebral haemorrhage has been excluded by cranial CT and neurological damage is not severe (i.e. coma), surgery indicated for HF, uncontrolled infection, abscess, or persistent high embolic risk should not be delayed and can be performed with a low neurological risk (3–6%) and good probability of complete neurological recovery. Conversely, in cases with intracranial haemorrhage, neurological prognosis is worse and surgery should generally be postponed for at least 1 month.

    "text": "Cardiac device-related IE CDRIE is one of the most difficult forms of IE to diagnose, and must be suspected in the presence of frequently misleading symptoms, particularly in elderly patients. Prognosis is poor, probably because of its frequent occurrence in elderly patients with associated comorbidities. In the majority of patients, CDRIE must be treated by prolonged antibiotic therapy and device removal. Cardiac device-related infective endocarditis: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention Recommendations Classa  Levelb  A. Diagnosis 1. Three or more sets of blood cultures are recommended before prompt initiation of antimicrobial therapy for CIED infection. I C 2. Lead-tip culture is indicated when the CIED is explanted. I C 3. TOE is recommended in patients with suspected CDRIE with positive or negative blood cultures, independent of the results of TTE, to evaluate lead-related endocarditis and heart valve infection. I C 4. Intracardiac echocardiography may be considered in patients with suspected CDRIE, positive blood cultures and negative TTE and TOE. IIb C 5. Radiolabelled leukocyte scintigraphy and 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning may be considered additive tools in patients with suspected CDRIE, positive blood cultures, and negative echocardiography. IIb C B. Principles of treatment 1. Prolonged (i.e. before and after extraction) antibiotic therapy and complete hardware (device and leads) removal are recommended in definite CDRIE, as well as in presumably isolated pocket infection. I C 2. Complete hardware removal should be considered on the basis of occult infection without other apparent source of infection. IIa C 3. In patients with NVE or PVE and an intracardiac device with no evidence of associated device infection, complete hardware extraction may be considered. IIb C C. Mode of device removal 1. Percutaneous extraction is recommended in most patients with CDRIE, even those with vegetations >10 mm. I B 2. Surgical extraction should be considered if percutaneous extraction is incomplete or impossible or when there is associated severe destructive tricuspid IE. IIa C 3. Surgical extraction may be considered in patients with large vegetations (>20 mm). IIb C D. Reimplantation 1. After device extraction, reassessment of the need for reimplantation is recommended. I C 2. When indicated, definite reimplantation should be postponed if possible to allow a few days or weeks of antibiotic therapy. IIa C 3. A “temporary” ipsilateral active fixation strategy may be considered in PM-dependent patients requiring appropriate antibiotic treatment before reimplantation. IIb C 4. Temporary pacing is not routinely recommended. III C E. Prophylaxis 1. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended before device implantation. I B 2. Potential sources of sepsis should be eliminated ≥2 weeks before implantation of a intravascular/cardiac foreign material, except in urgent procedures.

    "text": "Definitions The leading symptom in suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is chest pain. Based on the electrocardiogram (ECG), two groups of patients should be differentiated: 1. Patients with acute chest pain and persistent (>20 min) ST-segment elevation. This condition is termed ST-elevation ACS and generally reflects an acute total coronary occlusion. Most patients will ultimately develop an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The mainstay of treatment in these patients is immediate reperfusion by primary angioplasty or fibrinolytic therapy. 2. Patients with acute chest pain but no persistent ST-segment elevation. ECG changes may include transient ST-segment elevation, persistent or transien ST-segment depression, T-wave inversion, flat T-waves or pseudo-normalization of T waves, or the ECG may be normal. The clinical spectrum of non-ST-elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS) may range from patients free of symptoms at presentation to individuals with ongoing ischaemia, electrical or haemodynamic instability, or cardiac arrest. Universal definition of myocardial infarction Acute myocardial infarction (MI) defines cardiomyocyte necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with acute myocardial ischaemia. A combination of criteria is required to meet the diagnosis of acute MI, namely the detection of a rise and/or fall of a cardiac biomarker, preferably high-sensitivity cardiac troponin, with at least one value above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit, and at least one of the following: Symptoms of ischaemia. New or presumed new significant ST-T wave changes or left bundle branch block on 12-lead ECG. Development of pathological Q waves on ECG. Imaging evidence of new or presumed new loss of viable myocardium or regional wall motion abnormality. Intracoronary thrombus detected on angiography or autopsy. Type 1 MI: characterized by atherosclerotic plaque rupture, ulceration, fissure, erosion, or dissection with resulting intraluminal thrombus in one or more coronary arteries leading to decreased myocardial blood flow and/or distal embolisation and subsequent myocardial necrosis. The patient may have underlying severe coronary artery disease (CAD) but, on occasion (i.e. 5% to 20% of cases), non-obstructive coronary atherosclerosis or no CAD, particularly in women. Type 2 MI: myocardial necrosis in which a condition other than coronary plaque instability contributes to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Mechanisms include coronary artery spasm, coronary endothelial dysfunction, tachyarrhythmias, bradyarrhythmias, anaemia, respiratory failure, hypotension, and severe hypertension. In addition, in critically ill patients and in patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery, myocardial necrosis may be related to injurious effects of pharmacological agents and toxins.",

Physical examination is frequently unremarkable in patients with suspected NSTE-ACS. Signs of heart failure, haemodynamic or electrical instability mandate quick diagnosis and treatment. It is recommended to obtain an ECG within 10 min of first medical contact. While ECG may be normal, characteristic abnormalities include ST-depression, transient ST-elevation and T-wave changes. In patients with suggestive signs and symptoms, the finding of persistent ST-elevation indicates STEMI, which mandates immediate reperfusion. Measurement of a biomarker of cardiomyocyte injury, preferably high-sensitivity cardiac troponin, is mandatory in all patients with suspected NSTE-ACS.",

Levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin should be interpreted as quantitative markers of cardiomyocyte damage (i.e. the higher the level, the greater the likelihood of MI): Elevations beyond 5-fold the upper reference limit have high (>90%) positive predictive value for acute type 1 MI. Elevations up to 3-fold the upper reference limit have only limited (50–60%) positive predictive value for acute MI and may be associated with a broad spectrum of conditions. It is common to detect circulating levels of cardiac troponin in healthy individuals. Rising and/or falling cardiac troponin levels differentiate acute from chronic cardiomyocyte damage (the more pronounced the change, the higher the likelihood of acute MI).

The GRACE 2.0 risk calculator (http://www.gracescore.org/ WebSite/default. aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f) provides a direct estimation, bypassing the calculation of a score, of mortality while in hospital, at six months, one year and three years. The combined risk of death or MI at one year is also provided. The TIMI risk score is simple to use, but its discriminative accuracy is inferior to that of the GRACE 2.0 risk calculator. Major bleeding events are associated with increased mortality in NSTE-ACS. The CRUSADE bleeding risk score (http://crusadebleedingscore.org/) considers baseline patient characteristics, admission clinical variables and admission laboratory values to estimate the patient’s likelihood of in-hospital major bleeding event. However, model performance for the risk score is modest. The incidence of life-threatening arrhythmias in the acute phase of NSTE- ACS is estimated at 3%, with most of the arrhythmic events occurring within 12h of symptom onset.",

    "text": "Summary of mgmt. strategy Initial evaluation and pathway Step one: initial evaluation and pathway All patients with suspected NSTE-ACS must be addressed to an emergency department and must be evaluated rapidly by a qualified physician. The delay between first medical contact and ECG should be no longer than 10 minutes. The cardiac rhythm of the patient should be monitored. The working diagnosis of NSTE-ACS and the initial management should be based on following parameters: Chest pain characteristics, duration and persistence; symptom-oriented physical examination (e.g. systolic blood pressure, heart rate, cardio-pulmonary auscultation, Killip classification). Assessment of the probability of CAD based on chest pain characteristics, age, gender, CV risk factors, known CAD, non-cardiac manifestation of atherosclerosis. 12-lead ECG (to detect ST deviation or other abnormalities suggestive of myocardial ischaemia or necrosis). On the basis of these findings, the patient can be assigned to one of the four working diagnoses: STEMI NSTE-ACS with ongoing ischaemia or haemodynamic instability NSTE-ACS without ongoing ischaemia or haemodynamic instability NSTE-ACS unlikely The treatment of patients with STEMI is covered in the respective ESC guidelines. The assignment to the category “unlikely” must be done with caution, especially in patients with a specific condition, such as the elderly and those with diabetes mellitus, and only when another explanation is obvious. The initial treatment measure should include nitrates (sublingual or i.v.) for persisting chest pain, hypertension or heart failure. Oxygen therapy should be applied in the presence of a blood oxygen saturation <90% or respiratory distress. Morphine (iv. or s.c.) or alternative opiates are reserved for patients with persisting severe chest pain. In patients with ongoing chest pain and inconclusive ECG, consider immediate echocardiography to exclude alternative diagnoses (if appropriate in conjunction with CT angiography) such as pulmonary embolism, pericarditis, or aortic dissection and at the same time to reinforce the suspicion of NSTE-ACS (i.e. by identifying a focal wall motion abnormality). In the setting of ongoing myocardial ischaemia or haemodynamic compromise (the clinical suspicion should be corroborated by echocardiographic finding of regional wall motion abnormality) the patient should undergo immediate coronary angiography irrespective of ECG or biomarker findings to prevent life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and limit myocardial necrosis. Blood work on admission should include at least: (preferably high-sensitivity) cardiac troponin T or I, serum creatinine, haemoglobin, haematocrit, platelet count, blood glucose, and INR in patients on VKA. The results of the troponin measurements should be available within 60 minutes and troponin measurement should be repeated at 1–3 hours if high-sensitivity troponin assays are used. Patients with suspected NSTE-ACS should be observed in interdisciplinary emergency departments or chest pain units until the diagnosis of MI is confirmed or ruled out. If the diagnosis of NSTE-ACS is confirmed, the lipid profile should be assessed in the early phase of admission. In case of ongoing ischaemia, defibrillator patches should be placed until urgent revascularization is performed. It is recommended that medical and paramedical personnel caring for suspected NSTE-ACS patients have access to defibrillator equipment and are trained in advanced cardiac life support.",

Further management of the patient is based on responsiveness to antianginal treatment and risk assessment, as quantified by the GRACE 2.0 risk score , as well as on results of the subsequent troponin measurement (at 1–3hours, if high-sensitivity assays are used). Echocardiography is useful to identify abnormalities suggestive of myocardial ischaemia or necrosis (i.e. segmental hypokinesia or akinesia) and should be performed immediately in patients with haemodynamic instability of suspected CV origin. If aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism is suspected, echocardiography, D-dimer assessment and CT-angiography should be implemented according to the respective ESC Guidelines. Rhythm monitoring up to 24 hours or PCI (whichever comes first) should be considered in NSTEMI patients at low risk for cardiac arrhythmias (i.e. none of the following criteria: haemodynamically unstable, major arrhythmias, left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, failed reperfusion, additional critical coronary stenoses or complications related to percutaneous revascularization).

In patients intended for a conservative treatment and not at high bleeding risk, ticagrelor (preferred over clopidogrel) is recommended once the NSTEMI diagnosis is established.

    "text": "Invasive strategy Radial access for coronary angiography and, if needed, revascularization is recommended. Timing of angiography (calculated from first medical contact) can be classified in four categories based on risk profile of the individual patient (see PCI in NSTE-ACS) Immediate invasive strategy (<2 h). Paralleling the STEMI pathway, this strategy should be undertaken for patients with ongoing ischaemia, characterized by at least one very high-risk criterion. Centres without ongoing STEMI programs should transfer the patient immediately. Early invasive strategy (<24 h). Most patients in this category respond to the initial pharmacologic treatment, but are at increased risk and need early angiography followed by revascularization. Patients qualify if they have at least one high-risk criterion. This implies timely transfer for patients admitted to hospitals without onsite catheterisation facilities. Invasive strategy (<72 h). This is the recommended maximal delay for coronary angiography in patients without recurrence of symptoms but with at least one intermediate risk criterion. Urgent transfer to a hospital with onsite catheterisation facilities is not necessary, but the 72-h window for coronary angiography should be complied with. Selective invasive strategy Patients with no recurrence of chest pain, no signs of heart failure, no abnormalities in the initial or subsequent ECG, and no rise in (preferably high-sensitivity) cardiac troponin level are at low risk of subsequent CV events. In this setting, a noninvasive stress test (preferably with imaging) for inducible ischaemia is recommended before deciding on an invasive strategy.",

    "text": "Revascularisation modalities In the absence of dedicated trials, recommendations for PCI and CABG in stabilized NSTE-ACS are similar to those for stable CAD. In patients with single-vessel disease, PCI with stenting of the culprit lesion is the first choice. In patients with multivessel disease, the decision for PCI or CABG should be individualized through consultation with the Heart Team. A sequential approach, consisting of treating the culprit lesion with PCI followed by elective CABG with proof of ischaemia and/or FFR of the non-culprit lesions, may be advantageous in selected patients. In patients on a single antiplatelet agent (aspirin) undergoing PCI, the addition of a P2Y12 inhibitor (prasugrel or ticagrelor preferred over clopidogrel) is recommended. The anticoagulant should be selected based on both the ischaemic and bleeding risks and should not be changed during PCI. In patients pretreatedwith fondaparinux, UFH must be added before PCI. In naïve patients, consider bivalirudin. If CABG is planned and the patient is on a P2Y12 inhibitor, this should be stopped and surgery deferred if the clinical condition and the angiographic findings permit. If coronary angiography shows no options for revascularization, owing to the extent of the lesions and/or poor distal run-off, freedom from angina should be aimed for by intensifying medical therapy.",

New wordings and parameters for the haemodynamic definition of post- capillary PH sub-groups have been adopted. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) has been included in the haemodynamic definition of PAH. An updated common clinical classification, for adult and paediatric patients, is reported. New advances in pathology, pathobiology, genetics, epidemiology and risk factors are reported. An updated diagnostic algorithm has been provided in an independent chapter and novel screening strategies are proposed in the web addenda. The importance of expert referral centers in the management of PH patients has been highlighted in both the diagnostic and treatment algorithm. New developments on PAH severity evaluation and on treatments and treatment goals are reported, including combination therapy and two new drugs recently approved. The treatment algorithm has been updated accordingly. The chapters on PH due to LHD and lung diseases have been updated. The term “out of proportion PH” has been abandoned in both conditions. New diagnostic and treatment algorithms are reported in the CTEPH chapter, including general criteria for operability and for balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) and a new approved drug. A short chapter on PH due to unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms has been added.",

    "text": "Definitions and classifications Definitions General definitions PH is defined as an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAPm) ≥25 mmHg at rest as assessed by right heart catheterization (RHC). Available data has shown that the normal mean PAPm at rest is 14 ± 3 mmHg with an upper limit of normal of approximately 20 mmHg. The clinical significance of PAPm between 21 and 24 mmHg is unclear. Patients presenting with PAP in this range should be carefully followed, when they are at risk for developing PAH (e.g. patients with connective tissue disease (CTD) or family members of patients with heritable PAH (HPAH)). Due to the lack of reliable data that defines which levels of exercise-induced changes in PAPm or PVR have prognostic implications, a disease entity ´PH on exercise´ cannot be defined and should not be used. A recent retrospective study has proposed a definition of PH on exercise with the combination of PAPm and total PVR data, but no outcome prospective validation has been provided. The term PAH describes a group of PH patients characterized haemodynamically by the presence of pre-capillary PH defined by pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) ≤15 mmHg and a PVR >3 Wood units (WU) in the absence of other causes of pre-capillary PH such as PH due to lung diseases, CTEPH, or other rare diseases. According to various combinations of PAP, PAWP, cardiac output (CO), diastolic pressure gradient (DPG) and PVR, assessed in stable clinical conditions, different haemodynamic definitions of PH are shown in Table 3 together with their corresponding clinical classification in Table 4.",

Table 5 Clinical classification of pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease 1. Eisenmenger’s syndrome Includes all large intra- and extra-cardiac defects which begin as systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and progress with time to severe elevation of PVR and to reversal (pulmonary-to-systemic) or bidirectional shunting; cyanosis, secondary erythrocytosis, and multiple organ involvement are usually present. 2. PAH associated with prevalent systemic-to-pulmonary shunts Correctablea Non-correctable Includes moderate to large defects; PVR is mildly to moderately increased, systemic-to-pulmonary shunting is still prevalent, whereas cyanosis at rest is not a feature. 3. PAH with small/coincidentalb defects Marked elevation in PVR in the presence of small cardiac defects (usually ventricular septal defects <1 cm and atrial septal defects <2 cm of effective diameter assessed by echo), which themselves do not account for the development of elevated PVR; the clinical picture is very similar to idiopathic PAH. Closing the defects is contra-indicated. 4. PAH after defect correction Congenital heart disease is repaired, but PAH either persists immediately after correction or recurs/develops months or years after correction in the absence of significant postoperative haemodynamic lesions. PAH = pulmonary arterial hypertension; PVR = pulmonary vascular resistance. aWith surgery or intravascular percutaneous procedure. bThe size applies to adult patients. However, also in adults the simple diameter may be not sufficient for defining the haemodynamic relevance of the defect, and also the pressure gradient, the shunt size and direction, and the pulmonary to systemic flows ratio should be considered (Web Table II, available on the web at: www.escardio.org/guidelines).",

The interpretation of these investigations requires, at the very least, expertise in cardiology, imaging and respiratory medicine and may best be discussed at a multidisciplinary team meeting. The symptoms of PH are non-specific and they include shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness, angina, dry cough and syncope. Symptoms at rest occur only in advanced cases. The presentation of PH may be modified by diseases which cause or are associated with PH as well as other concurrent diseases. The physical signs of PH include left parasternal lift, an accentuated pulmonary component of the second heart sound, an RV third heart sound, a pansystolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation, and a diastolic murmur of pulmonary regurgitation. Elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatomegaly, ascites, peripheral oedema, and cool extremities characterize patients with advanced disease. Clinical examination may be modified by the underlying cause of PH.",

These investigations are selected according to the phase of the diagnostic process as shown in the Diagnostic Algorithm (Figure 1).

The electrocardiogram (ECG) may provide supportive evidence of PH showing signs of right atrial enlargement or right ventricular hypertrophy, but a normal ECG does not exclude the diagnosis. The chest radiograph is abnormal in many patients with PH at the time of diagnosis. Findings may include central pulmonary arterial dilatation and ‘pruning’ (loss) of the peripheral blood vessels. Transthoracic echocardiography has a central role in the diagnostic process providing imaging on the effects of PH on the heart and estimate PAP from continuous wave Doppler measurements. Pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gases will identify the contribution of underlying airway or parenchymal lung disease. The ventilation/perfusion lung scan should be performed in patients with PH to look for CTEPH. High-resolution computed tomography and contrast enhanced computed tomography of the chest will contribute to the identification of patients with lung diseases and CTEPH respectively. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance imaging is accurate and reproducible in assessment of right ventricle size, morphology, and function. Blood tests, immunology and abdominal ultrasound scan are not useful in diagnosing PH, but are required to identify the aetiology of some forms of PH as well as end organ damage. Right heart catheterization (RHC) is required to confirm the diagnosis of PAH and CTEPH, to assess the severity of haemodynamic impairment, and to undertake vasoreactivity testing of the pulmonary circulation in selected patients. Recommendations for RHC are provided in Table 9. Recommendations for vasoreactivity testing are provided in Table 10.",

The diagnostic process starts after the suspicion of PH and echocardiography compatible with PH (according to different levels of PH probability reported in Tables 7 and 8). In case of high or intermediate probability of PH, clinical history, symptoms, signs, ECG, chest radiograph, pulmonary function tests and high resolution CT of the chest are requested to identify the presence of Group 2 – LHD or Group 3 – lung diseases. If the diagnosis of left heart or lung diseases is confirmed, the appropriate treatment for these conditions should be considered. In presence of severe PH and/or RV dysfunction the patient should be referred to a PH expert center where additional causes of PH may be explored. In case of low probability of PH no additional investigation are required and other causes for symptoms should be considered together with follow-up. If the diagnosis of left heart or lung diseases is not confirmed a ventilation/ perfusion lung scan should be performed for the differential diagnosis between CTEPH and PAH. Concurrently, the patient should be referred to a PH expert center. If the ventilation/perfusion scan shows multiple segmental perfusion defects, a diagnosis of Group 4 – CTEPH should be suspected. The final diagnosis of CTEPH (and the assessment of suitability for PEA) will require CT pulmonary angiography, RHC and selective pulmonary angiography. PAH should be considered if a ventilation/perfusion scan is normal or shows only subsegmental “patchy” perfusion defects particularly in patients with associated conditions and/or risk factors for development of PAH such as family history, CTD, CHD, HIV infection, portal hypertension, or a history of drugs and toxins intake known to induce PAH. In Table 8 the further management according to the probability of PH is given including indications for RHC. Additional specific diagnostic tests including haematology, biochemistry, immunology, serology, ultrasonography and genetics will allow the final diagnosis to be refined.

    "text": "PAH Treatment algorithm A treatment algorithm for PAH patients is shown in Figure 2. The classes of recommendation and levels of evidence for the PAH treatments are shown in Tables 18 (monotherapy), 19 (initial combination therapy), 20 (sequential combination therapy) and 21 (intensive care treatment and interventions). Definition of clinical response to treatments is reported in Table 14. The PAH treatment algorithm does not apply to patients in other clinical groups, and in particular not to patients with PH associated with Group 2 – LHD or with Group 3 – lung diseases. In addition, the different treatments have been evaluated by RCTs mainly in IPAH, HPAH, PAH due to drugs, and in PAH associated with CTD or with CHD (surgically corrected or not). Treatment Algorithm Description (Figure 2). After the confirmation of the diagnosis of treatment naïve PAH patient in an expert center, the suggested initial approach is the adoption of the general measures and the initiation of the supportive therapy (Tables 15 and 16) if needed. Acute vasoreactivity testing should be performed only in patients with IPAH, HPAH, and PAH associated with drugs and toxins use. Vasoreactive patients should be treated with high doses (progressively titrated) of CCB; adequate response should be confirmed after 3–4 months of treatment (Table 17). Patients responders without an adequate clinical respose to CCB treatment should be treated with approved PAHmedications according with the non- vasoreactive patients treatment strategy. Non-responders to acute vasoreactivity testing who are at low or intermediate risk (Table 13) can be treated either with initial monotherapy (Table 18) or initial oral combination therapy (Table 19). If initial monotherapy is chosen, as head-to-head comparisons among different compounds are not available, no evidence-based first-line monotherapy can be proposed. In this case the choice of the drug may depend on a variety of factors including the approval status, the labelling, the route of administration, the side-effect profile, potential interaction with background therapies, patient preferences, comorbidities, physician experience, and the cost. As head-to-head comparison between initial combination therapy with ambrisentan plus tadalafil has proven to be superior to initial monotherapy with ambrisentan or tadalafil in delaying clinical failure, a higher grade of recommendation has been given to this initial combination (Table 19). In non-vasoreactive and treatment-naïve patients at high-risk (Table 13), initial combination therapy including intravenous prostacyclin analogues should be considered (Table 19). Intravenous epoprostenol should be prioritised as it has reduced the 3 months rate of mortality in high-risk PAH patients also as monotherapy (Table 18). Alternative types of initial combination therapy may be considered (Table 19). In case of inadequate clinical response to initial combination therapy or initial monotherapy (Table 14), sequential double or triple combination therapy is recommended according with Table 20. The combination of riociguat and PDE 5i is contra-indicated. In case of inadequate clinical response with sequential double combination therapy (Table 14), triple combination therapy should be attempted (Tables 19 and 20). It seems reasonable to consider eligibility for lung transplantation after an inadequate clinical response to the initial monotherapy or initial combination therapy, and to refer the patient for lung transplantation soon after the inadequate clinical response is confirmed on maximal combination therapy (Table 21). BAS should be regarded as a palliative or bridging procedure in patients deteriorating despite maximal medical therapy. Figure 2 Treatment algorithm for pulmonary arterial hypertension CCB = calcium channel blockers; DPAH = drug induced PAH; HPAH = heritable PAH; IPAH: = idiopathic PAH; i.v. = intravenous; PAH = pulmonary arterial hypertension; PCA = prostacyclin analogues. aSome WHO-FC III patients may be considered high-risk (see Table 13). bInitial combination with ambrisentan plus tadalafil has proven to be superior to initial monotherapy with ambrisentan or tadalafil in delaying clinical failure. cIntravenous epoprostenol should be prioritised as it has reduced the 3 months rate for mortality in high-risk PAH patients also as monotherapy. dConsider also balloon atrial septostomy.

By definition pericardial diseases affect the pericardial sac that has two layers, a serous visceral layer and a fibrous parietal layer, with a cavity that contains pericardial fluid. Pericardial diseases may be either isolated disease or part of a systemic disease. The main pericardial syndromes that are encountered in clinical practice include pericarditis (acute, subacute, chronic and recurrent), pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, and pericardial masses. A simple aetiological classification for pericardial diseases is to consider infectious and non-infectious causes. The aetiology is varied and depends on the epidemiologic background, patient population, and clinical setting. In developed countries, viruses are usually the most common aetiological agents of pericarditis, whereas tuberculosis is the most frequent cause of pericardial diseases in the world and developing countries, where tuberculosis is endemic. In this setting tuberculosis is often associated with HIV infection. Table 1 Aetiology of pericardial diseases A. Infectious causes Viral (common): Enteroviruses (Coxsackieviruses, Echoviruses), Herpesviruses (EBV, CMV, HHV-6), Adenoviruses, Parvovirus B19 (possible overlap with aetiologic viral agents of myocarditis). Bacterial: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (common, other bacterial rare), Coxiella burnetii, Borrelia burgdorferi, rarely: Pneumococcus spp, Meningococcus spp, Gonococcus spp, Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus spp, Haemophilus spp, Chlamydia spp, Mycoplasma spp, Legionella spp, Leptospira spp, Listeria spp, Providencia stuartii. Fungal (very rare): Histoplasma spp (more likely in immunocompetent patients), Aspergillus spp, Blastomyces spp, Candida spp (more likely in immunocompromised host). Parasitic (very rare): Echinococcus spp, Toxoplasma spp. B. Non-infectious causes Autoimmune (common): Systemic autoimmune and auto-inflammatory diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma), systemic vasculitides (i.e: eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis or allergic granulomatosis, previously named Churg-Strauss-Syndrome, Horton disease, Takayasu disease, Behçet syndrome), sarcoidosis, Familial Mediterranean Fever, inflammatory bowel diseases, Still disease. Neoplastic: Primary tumours (rare, above all pericardial mesothelioma). Secondary metastatic tumours (common, above all lung and breast cancer, lymphoma). Metabolic: Uraemia, myxoedema, anorexia nervosa, other rare. Traumatic and Iatrogenic: Early onset (rare): Direct injury (penetrating thoracic injury, aesophageal perforation).

A diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is based on the association of signs and symptoms of right heart failure and instrumental evidence of an impaired diastolic filling due to pericardial constriction by one or more imaging methods or cardiac catheterization.

Echocardiogram: the presence of a large pericardial effusion with frond-like projections, and thick ‘porridge-like’ fluid is suggestive of an exudate but not specific for a tuberculous aetiology. CT scan and/or MRI of the chest are alternative imaging modalities where available: look for evidence of pericardial effusion and thickening (>3 mm), and typical mediastinal and tracheobronchial lymphadenopathy (>10 mm, hypodense centres, matting), with sparing of hilar lymph nodes. Culture of sputum, gastric aspirate and/or urine for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) should be considered in all patients. Scalene lymph node biopsy if pericardial fluid is not accessible and lymphadenopathy present. Tuberculin skin test is not helpful in adults regardless of the background prevalence of tuberculosis. If pericardial fluid is not accessible, a diagnostic score of ≥6 based on the following criteria is highly suggestive of tuberculous pericarditis in people living in endemic areas: fever (1), night sweats (1), weight loss (2), globulin level >40 g/L (3) and peripheral leucocyte count <10 x 109/L (3). Stage 2: Pericardiocentesis Therapeutic pericardiocentesis is absolutely indicated in the presence of cardiac tamponade. Diagnostic pericardiocentesis should be considered in all patients with suspected tuberculous pericarditis, and the following tests performed on the pericardial fluid: Direct inoculation of the pericardial fluid into double strength liquid Kirchner culture medium (or equivalent medium), and culture for M. tuberculosis. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Xpert MTB/RIF) testing for nucleic acids of M. tuberculosis. Biochemical tests to distinguish between an exudate and atransudate (fluid and serum protein; fluid and serum LDH). White cell analysis and count, and cytology: a lymphocytic exudate favours tuberculous pericarditis. Indirect tests for tuberculous infection: interferon-gamma(IFN-γ), adenosine deaminase (ADA), or lysozyme assay. Stage 3: Pericardial biopsy “Therapeutic” biopsy: as part of surgical drainage in patients with cardiac tamponade relapsing after pericardiocentesis or requiring open drainage of pericardial fluid for reasons such as repeated accumulation of pericardial fluid or failure to respond to empiric medical therapy. Diagnostic biopsy: In areas where tuberculosis is endemic, a diagnostic biopsy is not required prior to commencing empiric antituberculosis treatment. In areas where tuberculosis is not endemic, a diagnostic biopsy is recommended in patients with >3 weeks of illness and without aetiologic diagnosis having been reached by other tests. Stage 4: Empiric antituberculosis chemotherapy Tuberculosis endemic in the population: trial of empiric antituberculosis chemotherapy is recommended for exudative pericardial effusion, after excluding other causes such as malignancy, uraemia, trauma, purulent pericarditis, and auto-immune diseases. Tuberculosis not endemic in the population: when systematic investigation fails to yield a diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis, there is no justification for starting antituberculosis treatment empirically.

Post-operative pericardial effusions are relatively common after cardiac surgery. Empiric anti-inflammatory therapy is not recommended in the absence of pericarditis. On the contrary, cardiac tamponade occurring in the first hours after cardiac surgery is usually due to haemorrhage in pericardial space and surgical reintervention is mandatory in this situation. Recommendations for management and prevention of post-cardiac injury syndromes (PCIS) Recommendations Class a Level b Anti-inflammatory therapy is recommended in patients with PCIS to hasten symptoms remission and reduce recurrences. I B Aspirinc is recommended as first choice for anti-inflammatory therapy of post-myocardial infarction pericarditis and those patients already on antiplatelet therapies. I C Colchicine added to aspirin or NSAIDs should be considered for the therapy of PCIS, as in acute pericarditis. IIa B Colchicine should be considered after cardiac surgery using weight-adjusted doses (i.e. 0.5 mg once for patients ≤70Kg and 0.5 mg twice daily if patients are >70 kg) and without a loading dose for the prevention of PPS if there are no contra-indications and it is tolerated. Preventive administration of colchicine is recommended for 1 month. IIa A Careful follow-up after PCIS should be considered to exclude possible evolution towards constrictive pericarditis with echocardiography every 6–12 months according to clinical features and symptoms.

    "text": "Definition and prevention of SCD Definitions Definitions of commonly used terms Term Definition Sudden death Non-traumatic, unexpected fatal event occurring within 1 hour of the onset of symptoms in an apparently healthy subject. If death is not witnessed, the definition applies when the victim was in good health 24 hours before the event. SUDS and SUDI Sudden death without an apparent cause and in which an autopsy has not been performed in an adult (SUDS) or in an infant <1 year of age (SUDI). Sudden cardiac death (SCD) The term is used when: A congenital, or acquired, potentially fatal cardiac condition was known to be present during life; OR Autopsy has identified a cardiac or vascular anomaly as the probable cause of the event; OR No obvious extra-cardiac causes have been identified by post-mortem examination and therefore an arrhythmic event is a likely cause of death. SADS and SIDS Both autopsy and toxicology investigations are inconclusive, the heart is structurally normal at gross and histological examination and non-cardiac aetiologies are excluded in adults (SADS) and in infants (SIDS). Aborted cardiac arrest (ACA) Unexpected circulatory arrest occurring within one hour of onset of acute symptoms, which is reversed by successful resuscitation manoeuvres (e.g. defibrillation). Idiopathic VF Clinical investigations are negative in a patient surviving an episode of ventricular fibrillation. Primary prevention of SCD Therapies to reduce the risk of SCD in individuals who are at risk of SCD, but have not yet experienced an aborted cardiac arrest or life-threatening arrhythmias. Secondary prevention of SCD Therapies to reduce the risk of SCD in patients who have already experienced an aborted cardiac arrest or life-threatening arrhythmias. SADS = sudden arrhythmic death syndrome; SCD = sudden cardiac death; SIDS = sudden infant death syndrome; SUDI = sudden unexplained death in infancy; SUDS = sudden unexplained death syndrome; VF = ventricular fibrillation. Cardiac diseases associated with SCD differ in young versus older individuals. In the young there is a predominance of channelopathies and cardiomyopathies, myocarditis and substance abuse, while in older populations chronic degenerative diseases predominate (CAD, valvular heart diseases and HF). The diagnosis of an inheritable arrhythmogenic disorder is established in up to 50% of families with a SADS victim.",

    "text": "Indications for autopsy Indications for autopsy and molecular autopsy in sudden death victims Recommendations Classa Level b An autopsy is recommended to investigate the causes of sudden death and to define whether a sudden cardiac death is secondary to arrhythmic or non-arrhythmic mechanisms (e.g. rupture of an aortic aneurysm). I C Whenever an autopsy is performed, a standard histological examination of the heart is recommended and it should include mapped labelled blocks of myocardium from representative transverse slices of both ventricles. I C The analysis of blood and other adequately collected body fluids for toxicology and molecular pathology is recommended in all victims of unexplained sudden death. I C Targeted post-mortem genetic analysis of potentially disease-causing genes should be considered in all sudden death victims in whom a specific inheritable channelopathy or cardiomyopathy is suspected. IIa C a Class of recommendation. b Level of evidence. Approximately 50% of cardiac arrests occur in individuals without a known heart disease, but most of them suffer from concealed ischaemic heart disease. Every time a heritable disease is identified in a deceased individual, the relatives of the victim may be at risk of being affected and dying suddenly unless a timely diagnosis is made and preventive measures taken.",

I A ECG monitoring Ambulatory ECG is recommended to detect and diagnose arrhythmias. 12-lead ambulatory ECG is recommended to evaluate QT-interval changes or ST changes. I A Cardiac event recorders are recommended when symptoms are sporadic, to establish whether they are caused by transient arrhythmias. I B Implantable loop recorders are recommended when symptoms, e.g. syncope, are sporadic and suspected to be related to arrhythmias and when a symptom–rhythm correlation cannot be established by conventional diagnostic techniques. I B SA-ECG is recommended to improve the diagnosis of ARVC in patients with VAs or in those who are at risk of developing life-threatening VAs. I B Exercise stress testing Exercise stress testing is recommended in adult patients with VA who have an intermediate or greater probability of having CAD by age and symptoms, to provoke ischaemic changes or VA. I B Exercise stress testing is recommended in patients with known or suspected exercise-induced VA including CPVT, to achieve a diagnosis and define prognosis. I B Exercise stress testing should be considered in evaluating response to medical or ablation therapy in patients with known exercise-induced VA. IIa C Imaging Echocardiography for assessment of LV function and detection of structural heart disease is recommended in all patients with suspected or known VA. I B Echocardiography for assessment of LV and RV function and detection of structural heart disease is recommended for patients at high risk of developing serious VAs or SCD, such as those with dilated, hypertrophic, or RV cardiomyopathies, survivors of acute myocardial infarction, or relatives of patients with inherited disorders associated with SCD. I B Exercise testing plus imaging (exercise stress echocardiography test or nuclear perfusion, SPECT) is recommended to detect silent ischaemia in patients with VAs who have an intermediate probability of having CAD by age, symptoms, and in whom an ECG is less reliable (digoxin use, LV hypertrophy, >1-mm ST-segment depression at rest, WPW syndrome, or LBBB). I B Pharmacological stress testing + imaging modality is recommended to detect silent ischaemia in patients with VAs who have an intermediate probability of having CAD by age, symptoms, and are physically unable to perform a symptom-limited exercise test.

Idioventricular rhythm Arrhythmia of three or more consecutive complexes originating from ventricles at a rate of <100 bpm. Monomorphic VT Stable single QRS morphology during VT. Non-sustained VT Three or more consecutive ventricular complexes in duration, terminating spontaneously in <30 seconds. Pleomorphic VT More than one stable QRS morphology during an episode of VT. Polymorphic VT A changing or multiform QRS morphology at heart rate between 100 and 300 bpm during VT. Premature ventricular complex A ventricular depolarization that occurs earlier than expected and appears on the ECG as an early, wide QRS complex without a preceding related P wave. Sustained VT VT ≥30 seconds in duration and/or requiring termination due to haemodynamic compromise in <30 seconds.

AF is one of the major causes of stroke, heart failure, sudden death, and cardiovascular morbidity, and is associated with poorer quality of life and adverse symptoms. The management of AF should include treatment of acute AF, cardiovascular risk reduction and treatment of comorbidities, stroke prevention using oral anticoagulation, heart rate control, and in selected symptomatic patients, the use of rhythm control therapy.",

AF-related symptoms are most commonly fatigue/tiredness and exertional shortness of breath, or less frequently palpitations and chest pain. A full cardiovascular evaluation, including an accurate history, careful clinical examination, and assessment of concomitant conditions is recommended in all AF patients, and transthoracic echocardiography can help to guide management.

The current definition of HF restricts itself to stages at which clinical symptoms are apparent. Before clinical symptoms become apparent, patients can present with asymptomatic structural or functional cardiac abnormalities [systolic or diastolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction], which are precursors of HF. Recognition of these precursors is important because they are related to poor outcomes, and starting treatment at the precursor stage may reduce mortality in patients with asymptomatic systolic LV dysfunction. Demonstration of an underlying cardiac cause is central to the diagnosis of HF. This is usually a myocardial abnormality causing systolic and/or diastolic ventricular dysfunction. However, abnormalities of the valves, pericardium, endocardium, heart rhythm and conduction can also cause HF (and more than one abnormality is of- ten present). Identification of the underlying cardiac problem is crucial for therapeutic reasons, as the precise pathology determines the specific treatment used (e.g. valve repair or replacement for valvular disease, specific pharmacological therapy for HF with reduced EF, reduction of heart rate in tachycardiomyopathy, etc).",

This group has decided to consider the lower limit of normal of LVEF in echocardiography as 50%, in line with the definition of cardiotoxicity commonly used in registries and trials in patients with cancer. A patient with a significant decrease in LVEF (e.g. a decrease >10%), to a value that does not drop below the lower limit of normal, should undergo repeated assessment of LVEF shortly after and during the duration of anticancer treatment. If LVEF decreases >10% to a value below the lower limit of normal (considered as an LVEF <50%), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)) in combination with beta-blockers are recommended to prevent further LV dysfunction or the development of symptomatic HF, unless contraindicated, as these patients are at high-risk of developing HF.

Smaller, more frequent meals may be helpful. Avoid dehydration and excess alcohol, particularly in patients with LVOTO. Constipation is a frequent side-effect of verapamil/disopyramide and should be managed with diet and if necessary aperients. Smoking There are no data that show an interaction between tobacco smoking and HCM, but patients should be provided with general advice on the health risks associated with smoking and, when available, information on smoking cessation. Sexual activity Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss their concerns about sexual activity. Anxiety and depression following a diagnosis are frequent and some patients may express guilt or fear about their genetic diagnosis and the risk of transmission to offspring. Patients should be counselled on the potential effect of their medication on sexual performance. In general, patients should avoid PDE5 inhibitors, particularly when they have LVOTO. Medication Patients should be provided with information about their medication, including potential side-effects and interactions with prescribed medications, over-the-counter remedies and other complementary therapies. Where possible, peripheral vasodilators should be avoided in patients, particularly when they have LVOTO. Vaccination In the absence of contra-indications, symptomatic patients should be advised to have yearly influenza vaccination. Driving Most patients should be eligible for an ordinary driving licence and can continue driving unless they experience distracting or disabling symptoms. Advice on driving licences for heavy goods or passenger-carrying vehicles should be in line with local legislation. For further advice on driving with ICD see EHRA guidancea and local rules. Occupation Most people with HCM will be able to continue in their normal job. The implications of heavy manual jobs that involve strenuous activity should be discussed with the appropriate specialist.

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) should be determined before and periodically during cardiotoxic treatment for early detection of cardiac dysfunction. This group has decided to consider the lower limit of normal of LVEF in echocardiography as 50%, in line with the definition of cardiotoxicity commonly used in registries and trials in patients with cancer. A patient with a significant decrease in LVEF (e.g. a decrease >10%), to a value that does not drop below the lower limit of normal, should undergo repeated assessment of LVEF shortly after and during the duration of anticancer treatment. If LVEF decreases >10% to a value below the lower limit of normal (considered as an LVEF <50%), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)) in combination with beta-blockers are recommended to prevent further LV dysfunction or the development of symptomatic HF, unless contraindicated, as these patients are at high-risk of developing HF.

Clinical evaluation and, when necessary, testing for detection of myocardial ischemia is key to identify patients with latent pre-existing CAD.

Patients treated with pyrimidine analogues should be closely monitored for myocardial ischaemia using regular ECGs, and chemotherapy should be withheld if myocardial ischaemia occurs.

However, clinical judgement is required when evaluating the risk at an individual level because of the lack of prospectively validated risk scores. Baseline risk assessment is often performed by the oncology team, but referral to a cardio-oncology specialist is highly recommended in high-risk patients. Strategies for screening and detection of cardiotoxicity include cardiac imaging and biomarkers (see Table 6). The choice of modalities depends upon local expertise and availability and several important core principles should be considered: The same imaging modality and/or biomarker assay should be used for continued screening throughout the treatment pathway. Switching between modalities or assays is strongly discouraged. Modalities and tests with the best reproducibility are preferred. Imaging modalities that provide additional relevant clinical information are preferred (e.g. right ventricular function, pulmonary pressures, valvular function, pericardial evaluation). High quality radiation-free imaging is preferred, if available. The precise timing and frequency of imaging and/or biomarker sampling will depend upon the specific cancer treatment, total cumulative dose of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, delivery protocol and duration and patient’s baseline cardiovascular risk.

If systolic dysfunction or significant VHD is found, the patient should be discussed with the oncology team, HF treatment should be started and options for non-anthracycline–containing chemotherapy should be considered. For higher dose anthracycline-containing regimens and in patients with high baseline risk, earlier assessment of cardiac function after a cumulative total doxorubicin (or equivalent) dose of 240 mg/m2 should be considered (Table 5). Measurement of at least one cardiac biomarker – high-sensitivity troponin (I or T) or either natriuretic peptide – may be considered at baseline and determination of high-sensitivity troponin I has been suggested with each cycle of anthracycline- containing chemotherapy.

Echocardiography is the method of choice for the detection of myocardial dysfunction and other cancer therapy side effects. CTRCD is defined as a decrease in the LVEF of >10 percentage points, to a value below the lower limit of normal. This decrease should be confirmed by repeated cardiac imaging in 2–3 weeks and may be further categorized as symptomatic or asymptomatic, or with regard to reversibility. 3D is associated with the best day-to-day reproducibility for measuring LVEF with echocardiography. Deformation imaging is a promising tool for early detection of LV dysfunction secondary to cancer therapy. A relative percentage reduction of GLS of >15% from baseline is considered abnormal and a marker of early LV subclinical dysfunction. Until standardization of strain imaging through different vendors is fully achieved, the current recommendation is to use the same equipment for the longitudinal follow-up of patients with cancer to facilitate the interpretation of results. Evaluation of LV function using multigated radionuclide angiography has been used for years. However, it is not recommended as a first-line option given the radiation exposure and the limited information on cardiac structure and haemodynamics. CMR is the gold standard for LVEF quantification and a helpful tool for the evaluation of cardiac structure and function. The use of the unique tissue characterization capabilities of CMR depends on T2 and T1 mapping and extracellular volume fraction quantification. Diffuse anthracycline fibrosis cannot be evaluated with conventional techniques of late gadolinium enhancement. The use of cardiac biomarkers during cardiotoxic chemotherapy may be considered in order to detect early cardiac injury. An abnormal biomarker result is indicative of an increased risk of cardiotoxicity. However, there is currently no clear evidence to withhold or interrupt chemotherapy or targeted therapies based on a new abnormal cardiac biomarker result. Single-centre studies show, that a newly elevated cardiac troponin I, from a normal baseline may identify those who develop cardiac dysfunction with a poor prognosis, particularly when troponin elevation persists and who may benefit from treatment with ACE-inhibitors. The role of cardiac biomarkers to detect cardiotoxicity due to targeted molecular therapies, including trastuzumab, and other immune and targeted cancer therapies is still unclear. The use of natriuretic peptides to detect HF is widely established and even very low levels can identify high-risk patients and guide therapy.

LVEF should be determined before and periodically during cardiotoxic treatment for early detection of cardiac dysfunction. This group has decided to consider the lower limit of normal LVEF in echocardiography as 50%, in line with the definition of cardiotoxicity commonly used in registries and trials in patients with cancer. A patient with a significant decrease in LVEF (e.g. a decrease >10%), to a value that does not drop below the lower limit of normal, should undergo repeated assessment of LVEF shortly after and during the duration of cancer treatment. If LVEF decreases >10% to a value below the lower limit of normal (considered as an LVEF <50%), ACE-inhibitors (or ARBs) in combination with beta-blockers are recommended to prevent further LV dysfunction or the development of symptomatic HF, unless contra-indicated, as these patients are at high-risk of developing HF.

QTc prolongation >500 ms and delta QT (i.e. change from baseline) of >60 ms are considered to be of particular concern because torsades de pointes rarely occurs when QTc is <500 ms. ECG and electrolyte monitoring during treatment should be considered at baseline, 7–15 days after initiation or changes in dose, monthly during the first 3 months, and then periodically during treatment, depending on the chemotherapy drug and patient status. Patients experiencing diarrhoea should be monitored more frequently and those receiving treatment with arsenic trioxide should be monitored weekly with ECG. Management is generally dependent on correcting the predisposing factors (e.g. concomitant electrolyte abnormalities, QT-prolonging drugs). A full list of QT-prolonging drugs, and which concomitant drugs should be avoided whenever possible, can be found at www.crediblemeds.org. If during treatment QTc is >500 ms (or QTc prolongation is >60 ms above baseline), then treatment should be temporarily interrupted, electrolyte abnormalities corrected and cardiac risk factors for QT prolongation controlled. Treatment can then be resumed at a reduced dose once the QTc normalizes. The development of bursts of torsade de tointes is unusual, but requires intravenous administration of magnesium sulphate (10 mL) and, in some acute situations, overdrive transvenous pacing or isoprenaline titrated to a heart rate >90 beats per minute to prevent new episodes in the acute setting. If sustained ventricular arrhythmias and haemodynamic instability occur, then non- synchronized defibrillation must be performed. A 12-lead ECG should be recorded and the QT interval, corrected for heart rate with Bazett’s or Fridericia’s formula, should be obtained in all patients at baseline. Patients with a history of QT prolongation, relevant cardiac disease, treated with QT-prolonging drugs, with bradycardia, thyroid dysfunction, or electrolyte abnormalities, should be monitored by repeated 12-lead ECG. Consider treatment discontinuation or alternative regimens if the QTc is >500 ms, QTc prolongation >60 ms, or dysrhythmias are encountered. Conditions known to provoke torsades de pointes, especially hypokalemia and extreme bradycardia, should be avoided in patients with drug-induced QT prolongation.

    "text": "4.4.2.2 Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter The initial approach to the management of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter requires the usual decisions regarding rhythm management, thromboembolic prophylaxis, and effective stroke prevention with oral anticoagulation. Whilst cancer may cause a prothrombotic state, it may also predispose to bleeding. On the other hand, the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED risk scores have not been validated in patients with cancer. Thus, the decision on antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention should not be based only on the risk assessment scores used for the general population. In patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of ≥2, anticoagulation can generally be considered if the platelet count is >50 000/mm3, usually with a vitamin K antagonist and with good anticoagulation control (with time in therapeutic range >70%). The occurrence of atrial fibrillation at any point (e.g. during chemotherapy, surgery, or radiotherapy) suggests an intrinsic predisposition to arrhythmia. In terms of thromboprophylaxis, this again depends on the presence of stroke risk factors, where anticoagulation would be recommended with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of ≥2. Even for lower-risk patients with atrial fibrillation, prophylaxis may be considered, given the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer. Full assessment of the patient, including echocardiography, is advised and decisions on anticoagulation should consider other comorbidities, bleeding risks, and patient values and preferences. Anticoagulation options include therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (as a short- to intermediate-term measure), a vitamin K antagonist (e.g. warfarin) if international normalized ratio control is stable and effective; or a non-VKA oral anticoagulant (NOAC). Warfarin is often avoided in patients with cancer with metastatic disease and high bleeding risk, with LMWH the traditionally preferred option given the risk for variations in international normalized ratio. The role and safety of NOACs in this patient group remains to be clarified. Although trials generally excluded patients with a platelet count of <100 000/mm3 or limited survival, a meta-analysis of the patients with cancer in NOAC trials suggested these new drugs to be safe.",

Linear accelerator photons allowing treatment of patients with equal weighting of anterior and posterior portals with subcarinal block and shrinking field technique.

Tracking systems allowing the energy to be directed at any part of the body from any location. This method of radiotherapy treatment resembles a surgical treatment and is also named ‘radiosurgery’.

The existing evidence supporting cardiovascular preventive strategies in cardio-oncology are only suggestive and require further validation. Secondary prevention has already entered clinical practice guidelines despite persistent unresolved questions. Prospectively validated criteria of early cardiotoxicity, which would be representative of late morbidity and mortality, are needed. The sensitivity of the current approach based on serial assessment of LVEF is insufficient. Several circulating biomarkers (troponin I and BNP or NT-proBNP) have been identified as useful for the early detection of myocardial dysfunction and overt HF related to cancer therapies. However, conclusive data are needed to establish whether biomarkers reliably predict clinically relevant late consequences of cancer treatment. The effect of interrupting cancer therapy remains to be determined, but should not be taken lightly as there are examples in general of interruptions or incomplete treatment courses having an adverse effect on optimal cancer- treatment outcomes.",

By 2030, 14-17 million AF patients are anticipated in the European Union, with 120 000-215 000 newly diagnosed patients per year. AF is independently associated with an increased risk of death and high levels of morbidity, such as heart failure and stroke, as well as frequent hospitalisation and reduced quality of life (Table 3). Table 3 Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with AF Event Association with AF Death Increased mortality, especially cardiovascular mortality due to sudden death, heart failure or stroke. Stroke 20-30% of all strokes are due to AF. A growing number of patients with stroke are diagnosed with ‘silent’, paroxysmal AF. Hospitalizations 10-40% of AF patients are hospitalized every year. Quality of life Quality of life is impaired in AF patients independent of other cardiovascular conditions. Left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure Left ventricular dysfunction is found in 20-30% of all AF patients. AF causes or aggravates LV dysfunction in many AF patients, while others have completely preserved LV function despite long-standing AF.

Increased atrial pressure and atrial structural remodelling, together with activation of the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin system. Focal AF Patients with repetitive atrial runs and frequent, short episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Often highly symptomatic, younger patients with distinguishable atrial waves (coarse AF), atrial ectopy, and/or atrial tachycardia deteriorating in AF. Localized triggers, in most cases originating from the pulmonary veins, initiate AF. AF due to one or a few re-entrant drivers is also considered to be part of this type of AF. Polygenic AF AF in carriers of common gene variants that have been associated with early onset AF. Currently under study.The presence of selected gene variants may also influence treatment outcomes. Post-operative AF New onset of AF (usually self- terminating) after major (typically cardiac) surgery in patients who were in sinus rhythm before surgery and had no prior history of AF. Acute factors: inflammation, atrial oxidative stress, high sympathetic tone, electrolyte changes, and volume overload, possibly interacting with a pre-existing substrate. AF in patients with mitral stenois or prosthetic heart valves AF in patients with mitral stenosis, after mitral valve surgery and in some cases other valvular disease. Left atrial pressure (stenosis) and volume (regurgitation) load are the main drivers of atrial enlargement and structural atrial remodelling in these patients. AF in athletes Usually paroxysmal, related to duration and intensity of training. Increased vagal tone and atrial volume. Monogenic AF AF in patients with inherited cardiomyopathies, including channelopathies.

The initial assessment of patients presenting with newly diagnosed AF should address five major domains: haemodynamic stability, the presence of precipitating factors or underlying conditions, stroke risk and anticoagulation, rate control, and the need for rhythm control therapy (Figure 3). Several diagnostic procedures are needed to define the best AF management. Review by an AF service is usually recommended, including urgent referral in some patients (Table 7). An integrated, structured approach to AF care, as applied successfully to other domains of medicine, will facilitate consistent, guideline-adherent AF management for all patients, with the potential to improve outcomes. AF management comprises therapies with prognostic impact (anticoagulation and treatment of cardiovascular conditions) and therapies predominantly providing symptomatic benefit (rate control, rhythm control). Explaining the expected benefits to each patient at the start of AF management will prevent unfounded expectations and has the potential to optimize quality of life.",

The optimal heart rate target in AF patients is unclear but evidence suggests that lenient rate control (heart rate <110 beats/ minute at rest) is an acceptable initial approach unless symptoms call for stricter rate control. Bradycardia should be avoided. Beta-blockers are often the first-line rate-controlling agent, although even in patients with HFrEF, there is no prognostic benefit in AF. Verapamil or diltiazem are suitable rate control agents in AF patients with LVEF ≥ 40% and have been shown to reduce symptoms. Cardiac glycosides such as digoxin and digitoxin have a limited evidence base, but seem effective in controlling rate without measurable effects on mortality. Ablation of the atrioventricular node/His bundle can effectively control ventricular rate when medications fail, but requires the implantation of a permanent pacemaker. In critically ill patients and those with severely impaired LV systolic function, intravenous amiodarone is also an option, and urgent cardioversion should always be considered in unstable patients.",

Ongoing trials will need to report before we can comment on a benefit of rhythm control therapy beyond symptom improvement. Electrical cardioversion is a useful technique for rhythm control, particularly in acute situations and in symptomatic patients with chronic AF (Figure 12). Antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) approximately double the rate of conversion to sinus rhythm compared with placebo. They can be used for cardioversion without sedation (Table 12), including &quot;pill in the pocket&quot; management. Catheter ablation, surgical ablation, or combination/hybrid therapy is often effective when AAD fail, and can be a first-line treatment for selected patients. Patients who have been in AF for longer than 48 hours should start OAC at least 3 weeks before cardioversion and continue it for 4 weeks afterwards (or indefinitely if stroke risk factors are present).

    "text": "Long-term rhythm control Overview Long-term use of AAD should consider that: The aim of treatment is to reduce AF-related symptoms. Efficacy of AAD to maintain sinus rhythm is modest. Clinically successful AAD may reduce rather than eliminate the recurrence of AF. If one AAD ‘fails’, a clinically acceptable response may be achieved with another agent. Drug-induced proarrhythmia or extra-cardiac side-effects are frequent. Safety rather than efficacy considerations should primarily guide the choice of AAD. To reduce the risk of side effects, a shorter duration of AAD seems desirable, for example after cardioversion or ablation. Longer-term use should carefully consider the safety profile of each AAD and patient characteristics (Figure 13). Careful analysis of ECG changes during the initiation of AAD (PR, QRS and QT intervals) can identify patients at risk of drug-induced proarrhythmia (Table 13). AAD should not be used in patients with existing QT prolongation, or those with significant sinoatrial or atrioventricular node dysfunction who do not have an implanted pacemaker. Catheter ablation is indicated to improve AF symptoms in patients who have symptomatic recurrences of AF on AAD, or as an alternative to AAD in selected patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF, performed in experienced centres by adequately trained teams. To minimize periprocedural complications (Table 13), patients should undergo AF ablation on continuous OAC. Patients with recurrences of AF on several AAD and/or after catheter ablation should be discussed in an AF Heart Team. Management of concomitant cardiovascular conditions can also reduce symptom burden in AF and facilitate maintenance of sinus rhythm, including weight reduction, blood pressure control, heart failure treatment and moderate exercise. ACE inhibitors, ARBs and beta-blockers reduce new-onset AF in patients with structural heart disease.",

    "text": "Rhythm control therapy mgmt. Recommendations for rhythm control therapy Recommendations Classa Levelb General recommendations Rhythm control therapy is indicated for symptom improvement in patients with AF. I B Management of cardiovascular risk factors and avoidance of AF triggers should be pursued in patients on rhythm control therapy to facilitate maintenance of sinus rhythm. IIa B With the exception of AF associated with haemodynamic instability, the choice between electrical and pharmacological cardioversion should be guided by patient and physician preferences. IIa C Cardioversion of AF Electrical cardioversion of AF is recommended in patients with acute haemodynamic instability to acutely restore cardiac output. I B Cardioversion of AF (either electrical or pharmacological) is recommended in symptomatic patients with persistent or long- standing persistent AF as part of rhythm control therapy. I B Pre-treatment with amiodarone, flecainide, ibutilide, or propafenone should be considered to enhance success of electrical cardioversion and prevent recurrent AF. IIa B In patients with no history of ischaemic or structural heart disease, flecainide, propafenone or vernakalant are recommended for pharmacological cardioversion of new-onset AF. I A In patients with no history of ischaemic or structural heart disease, ibutilide should be considered for pharmacological conversion of AF. IIa B In selected patients with recent-onset AF and no significant structural or ischaemic heart disease, a single oral dose of flecainide or propafenone (the &#39;pill in the pocket&#39; approach) should be considered for patient-led cardioversion, following safety assessment. IIa B In patients with ischaemic and/or structural heart disease, amiodarone is recommended for cardioversion of AF. I A Vernakalant may be considered as an alternative to amiodarone for pharmacological conversion of AF in patients without hypotension, severe heart failure or severe structural heart disease (especially aortic stenosis). IIb B Stroke prevention in patients designated for cardioversion of AF Anticoagulation with heparin or a NOAC should be initiated as soon as possible before every cardioversion of AF or atrial flutter. IIa B For cardioversion of AF/atrial flutter, effective anticoagulation is recommended for a minimum of 3 weeks before cardioversion. I B Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) is recommended to exclude cardiac thrombus as an alternative to preprocedural anticoagulation when early cardioversion is planned. I B Early cardioversion can be performed without TOE in patients with a definite duration of AF <48 hours. IIa B In patients at risk for stroke, anticoagulant therapy should be continued long-term after cardioversion according to the long-term anticoagulation recommendations, irrespective of the method of cardioversion or the apparent maintenance of sinus rhythm. In patients without stroke risk factors, anticoagulation is recommended for 4 weeks after cardioversion. I B In patients where thrombus is identified on TOE, effective anticoagulation is recommended for at least 3 weeks. I C A repeat TOE to ensure thrombus resolution should be considered before cardioversion. IIa C Anti-arrhythmic drugs for the long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm/prevention of recurrent AF The choice of AAD needs to be carefully evaluated, taking into account the presence of comorbidities, cardiovascular risk and potential for serious proarrhythmia, extracardiac toxic effects, patient preferences, and symptom burden. I A Dronedarone, flecainide, propafenone, or sotalol are recommended for prevention of recurrent symptomatic AF in patients with normal left ventricular function and without pathological left ventricular hypertrophy. I A Dronedarone is recommended for prevention of recurrent symptomatic AF in patients with stable coronary artery disease, and without heart failure. I A Amiodarone is recommended for prevention of recurrent symptomatic AF in patients with heart failure. I B Amiodarone is more effective in preventing AF recurrences than other AAD, but extracardiac toxic effects are common and increase with time. For this reason, other AAD should be considered first. IIa C Patients on AAD therapy should be periodically evaluated to confirm their eligibility for treatment. IIa C ECG recording during the initiation of AAD therapy should be considered to monitor heart rate, detect QRS and QT interval prolongation, and the occurrence of AV block. IIa B AAD therapy is not recommended in patients with prolonged QT interval (>0.5 s) or those with significant sinoatrial node disease or AV node dysfunction who do not have a functioning permanent pacemaker. III (harm) C Adding atrial-based bradycardia pacing to drug treatment that induces or exacerbates sinus node dysfunction should be considered to allow continuation of AAD therapy in patients in whom AF ablation is declined or not indicated. IIa B Continuation of AAD therapy beyond the blanking period after AF ablation should be considered to maintain sinus rhythm when recurrences seem likely. IIa B Antiarrhythmic effects of non-antiarrhythmic drugs ACE-Is, ARBs and beta-blockers should be considered for prevention of new-onset AF in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. IIa A ACE-Is and ARBs should be considered for prevention of new-onset AF in patients with hypertension, particularly with LV hypertrophy. IIa B Pre-treatment with ACE-Is or ARBs may be considered in patients with recurrent AF undergoing electrical cardioversion and receiving antiarrhythmic drug therapy. IIb B ARBs or ACE-Is are not recommended for the secondary prevention of paroxysmal AF in patients with little or no underlying heart disease.

Recommendations for catheter ablation of AF and AF surgery Recommendations Classa Levelb Catheter ablation of symptomatic paroxysmal AF is recommended to improve AF symptoms in patients who have symptomatic recurrences of AF on antiarrhythmic drug therapy (amiodarone, dronedarone, flecainide, propafenone, sotalol) and who prefer further rhythm control therapy, when performed by an electrophysiologist who has received appropriate training and is performing the procedure in an experienced centre. I A Ablation of common atrial flutter should be considered to prevent recurrent flutter as part of an AF ablation procedure if previously documented or occurring during the AF ablation. IIa B Catheter ablation of AF should be considered as first-line therapy to prevent recurrent AF and to improve symptoms in selected patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF as an alternative to antiarrhythmic drug therapy, considering patient choice, benefit, and risk. IIa B All patients should receive oral anticoagulation for at least 8 weeks after catheter (IIaB) or surgical (IIaC) ablation. IIa B C Anticoagulation for stroke prevention should be continued indefinitely after apparently successful catheter or surgical ablation of AF in patients at high-risk of stroke. IIa C When catheter ablation of AF is planned, continuation of oral anticoagulation with a VKA (IIaB) or NOAC (IIaC) should be considered during the procedure, maintaining effective anticoagulation. IIa B C Catheter ablation should target isolation of the pulmonary veins using radiofrequency ablation or cryothermy balloon catheters. IIa B AF ablation should be considered in symptomatic patients with AF and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction to improve symptoms and cardiac function when tachycardiomyopathy is suspected. IIa C AF ablation should be considered as a strategy to avoid pacemaker implantation in patients with AF-related bradycardia. IIa C Catheter or surgical ablation should be considered in patients with symptomatic persistent or long-standing persistent AF refractory to AAD therapy to improve symptoms, considering patient choice, benefit and risk, supported by an AF Heart Team. IIa C Minimally invasive surgery with epicardial pulmonary vein isolation should be considered in patients with symptomatic AF when catheter ablation has failed. Decisions on such patients should be supported by an AF Heart Team. IIa B Maze surgery, possibly via a minimally invasive approach, performed by an adequately trained operator in an experienced centre, should be considered by an AF Heart Team as a treatment option for patients with symptomatic refractory persistent AF or post-ablation AF to improve symptoms. IIa C Maze surgery, preferably biatrial, should be considered in patients undergoing cardiac surgery to improve symptoms attributable to AF, balancing the added risk of the procedure and the benefit of rhythm control therapy. IIa A Concomitant biatrial maze or pulmonary vein isolation may be considered in asymptomatic AF patients undergoing cardiac surgery. IIb C AF = atrial fibrillation; NOAC = non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant; VKA = vitamin K antagonist. aClass of recommendation. bLevel of evidence.",

Available rate and rhythm control interventions, including pacemakers and catheter ablation, should be used without discriminating by age. Individual patients at older age may present with multiple comorbidities which may limit quality of life more than AF-related symptoms. Impairment of renal and hepatic function and multiple simultaneous medications make drug interactions and adverse drug reactions more likely. Integrated AF management and careful adaptation of drug dosing seem reasonable to reduce complications of AF therapy in frail patients.",

AF is the most common arrhythmia in patients with HCM, associated with a high stroke risk and the need for OAC. New-onset AF in young, otherwise healthy individuals should trigger a careful search for inherited conditions, including clinical history, family history, ECG phenotype, cardiac imaging and targeted genetic testing.

Anticoagulants need to be selected considering potential risks to the foetus. For rate control, beta-blockers and/or digoxin are preferred and carry a US FDA pregnancy safety category of C (benefits may outweigh risk), except for atenolol (category D: positive evidence of risk). All rate control agents are present in breast milk, although levels of beta-blockers, digoxin, and verapamil are usually too low to be considered harmful. For rhythm control, flecainide and sotalol can be used. Electrical cardioversion is effective in cases of haemodynamic instability, but requires foetal monitoring. Recommendations during pregnancy Recommendations Classa Levelb Electrical cardioversion can be performed safely at all stages of pregnancy, and is recommended in patients who are haemodynamically unstable due to AF, and whenever the risk of ongoing AF is considered high, for the mother or the foetus. I C Anticoagulation is recommended in pregnant patients with AF at risk of stroke. To minimize teratogenic risk and intrauterine bleeding, dose-adjusted heparin is recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy and in the 2‐4 weeks before delivery.

    "text": "1.0.0.0 Overview Heart Failure is a clinical syndrome characterized by typical symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, ankle swelling and fatigue) that may be accompanied by signs (e.g. elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles and peripheral oedema) caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality, resulting in a reduced cardiac output and/ or elevated intracardiac pressures at rest or during stress. The current definition of HF restricts itself to stages at which clinical symptoms are apparent. Before clinical symptoms become apparent, patients can present with asymptomatic structural or functional cardiac abnormalities [systolic or diastolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction], which are precursors of HF. Recognition of these precursors is important because they are related to poor outcomes, and starting treatment at the precursor stage may reduce mortality in patients with asymptomatic systolic LV dysfunction. Demonstration of an underlying cardiac cause is central to the diagnosis of HF. This is usually a myocardial abnormality causing systolic and/or diastolic ventricular dysfunction. However, abnormalities of the valves, pericardium, endocardium, heart rhythm and conduction can also cause HF (and more than one abnormality is of- ten present). Identification of the underlying cardiac problem is crucial for therapeutic reasons, as the precise pathology determines the specific treatment used (e.g. valve repair or replacement for valvular disease, specific pharmacological therapy for HF with reduced EF, reduction of heart rate in tachycardiomyopathy, etc).",

The principal changes from the 2012 guidelines relate to: a new term for patients with HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) that ranges from 40 to 49% — ‘HF with mid-range EF (HFmrEF)’; clear recommendations on the diagnostic criteria for HF with reduced EF (HFrEF), HFmrEF and HF with preserved EF (HFpEF); a new algorithm for the diagnosis of HF in the non-acute setting based on the evaluation of HF probability; recommendations aimed at prevention or delay of the development of overt HF or the prevention of death before the onset of symptoms; indications for the use of the new compound sacubitril/valsartan, the first in the class of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs); modified indications for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT); the concept of an early initiation of appropriate therapy going along with relevant investigations in acute HF that follows the ‘time to therapy’ approach already well established in acute coronary syndrome (ACS); a new algorithm for a combined diagnosis and treatment approach of acute HF based on the presence/absence of congestion/hypoperfusion.",

Before clinical symptoms become apparent, patients can present with asymptomatic structural or functional cardiac abnormalities (systolic or diastolic left ventricular dysfunction), which are precursors of HF. Demonstration of an underlying cardiac cause is central to the diagnosis of HF. HF compromises a wide range of patients from those with normal LVEF (HFpEF) to those with reduced LVEF (HFrEF). Patients with an LVEF in the range of 40-49% represent a ‘grey area’, which is defined as HFmrEF (Table 1). For HFpEF/HFmrEF, key structural alterations are a left atrial volume index (LAVI) >34 mL/m2 or a left ventricular mass index (LVMI) ≥115 g/m2 for males and ≥95 g/m2 for females. Key functional alterations are an E/e’ ≥13 and a mean e’ septal and lateral wall <9 cm/s. In case of uncertainty, a stress test or invasively measured elevated LV filling pressure may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.

The diagnosis of HF in the acute setting is discussed in Section Acute heart failure. For patients presenting with symptoms or signs for the first time, non-urgently in primary care or in a hospital outpatient clinic, the probability of HF should first be evaluated based on the patient’s prior clinical history, physical examination and resting ECG. If all elements are normal, HF is highly unlikely and other diagnoses need to be considered. If at least one element is abnormal, plasma natriuretic peptides (NPs) should be measured, if available, to identify those who need echocardiography (an echocardiogram is indicated if the NPs level is above the exclusion threshold or if circulating NPs levels cannot be assessed). The use of NPs is recommended for ruling-out HF, but not to establish the diagnosis. There are numerous cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular cases of elevated NPs that may impede their interpretation in HF (e.g. atrial fibrillation, older age, renal failure).

    "text": "6.2.0.0 Imaging w/ suspected or established HF The most important clinical indications for the applicability of certain imaging methods in patients with suspected or confirmed HF are shown in the table below. Recommendations for cardiac imaging in patients with suspected or established heart failure Recommendations Classa Levelb TTE is recommended for the assessment of myocardial structure and function in subjects with suspected HF in order to establish a diagnosis of either HFrEF, HFmrEF or HFpEF. I C TTE is recommended to assess LVEF in order to identify patients with HF who would be suitable for evidence-based pharmacological and device (ICD, CRT) treatment recommended for HFrEF. I C TTE is recommended for the assessment of valve disease, right ventricular function and pulmonary arterial pressure in patients with an already established diagnosis of either HFrEF, HFmrEF or HFpEF in order to identify those suitable for correction of valve disease. I C TTE is recommended for the assessment of myocardial structure and function in subjects to be exposed to treatment which potentially can damage myocardium (e.g. chemotherapy). I C Other techniques (including systolic tissue Doppler velocities and deformation indices, i.e. strain and strain rate) should be considered in a TTE protocol in subjects at risk of developing HF in order to identify myocardial dysfunction at the preclinical stage. IIa C CMR is recommended for the assessment of myocardial structure and function (including right heart) in subjects with poor acoustic window and patients with complex congenital heart diseases (taking account of cautions/contra-indications to CMR). I C CMR with LGE should be considered in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy in order to distinguish between ischaemic and non- ischaemic myocardial damage in case of equivocal clinical and other imaging data (taking account of cautions/contra-indications to CMR). IIa C CMR is recommended for the characterization of myocardial tissue in case of suspected myocarditis, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, Chagas disease, Fabry disease non-compaction cardiomyopathy, and haemochromatosis (taking account of cautions/contra-indications to CMR). I C Non-invasive stress imaging (CMR, stress echocardiography, SPECT, PET) may be considered for the assessment of myocardial ischaemia and viability in patients with HF and CAD (considered suitable for coronary revascularization) before the decision on revascularization. IIb B Invasive coronary angiography is recommended in patients with HF and angina pectoris recalcitrant to pharmacological therapy or symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias or aborted cardiac arrest (who are considered suitable for potential coronary revascularization) in order to establish the diagnosis of CAD and its severity. I C Invasive coronary angiography should be considered in patients with HF and intermediate to high pre-test probability of CAD and the presence of ischaemia in non-invasive stress tests (who are considered suitable for potential coronary revascularization) in order to establish the diagnosis of CAD and its severity.

    "text": "9.2.0.0 CRT Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves cardiac performance in appropriately selected patients and improves symptoms and well-being, and reduces morbidity and mortality. Not all patients respond favourably to CRT. Several characteristics predict improvement in morbidity and mortality, and the extent of reverse remodelling is one of the most important mechanisms of action of CRT. Patients with ischaemic aetiology will have less improvement in LV function due to myocardial scar tissue, which is less likely to undergo favourable remodelling. Conversely, women may be more likely to respond than men, possibly due to smaller body and heart size. QRS width as well as QRS morphology have been related to a beneficial response to CRT. Several studies have shown that patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology are more likely to respond favourably to CRT, whereas there is less certainty about patients with non-LBBB morphology. However, patients with LBBB morphology often have wider QRS duration, and there is a current debate about whether QRS duration or QRS morphology is the main predictor of a beneficial response to CRT. If a patient is scheduled to receive an ICD and is in sinus rhythm with a QRS duration ≥130 ms, CRT-D should be considered if QRS is between 130 and 149 ms and is recommended if QRS is ≥150 ms. Implantation of CRT is not recommended if QRS duration is <130 ms. Imaging tests for dyssynchrony have not yet been shown to be of value in selecting patients for CRT.

However, since these patients are often elderly and highly symptomatic, and often have a poor quality of life, an important aim of therapy may be to alleviate symptoms and improve well-being. Diuretics will usually improve congestion, if present, thereby improving symptoms and signs of HF. The evidence that diuretics improve symptoms is similar across the spectrum of LVEF. Evidence that beta-blockers and MRAs improve symptoms in these patients is lacking. There is inconsistent evidence for an improvement in symptoms in those treated with ARBs (only for candesartan was there an improvement in NYHA class) and ACE-Is. For patients in sinus rhythm, there is some evidence that nebivolol, digoxin, spironolactone and candesartan might reduce HF hospitalizations. For patients in AF, beta-blockers do not appear to be effective and digoxin has not been studied. The evidence in support of either ARBs or ACE-Is is inconclusive.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in HF irrespective of LVEF. It increases the risk of thromboembolic events and may impair cardiac function worsening symptoms. These issues need to be considered in patients with HF presenting with AF, especially with a first diagnosed episode of AF or paroxysmal AF: identification of potentially correctable causes (e.g. hyperthyroidism, electrolyte disorders) and precipitating factors (e.g. recent surgery, chest infection); assessment of stroke risk and need for anticoagulation; assessment of ventricular rate and need for rate control; evaluations of symptoms of HF and AF. Many treatments for HF, including ACE-Is, ARBs, beta-blockers and MRAs, will reduce the incidence of AF, but ivabradine may increase it. CRT has little effect on the incidence of AF. For new-onset, rapid AF, rate control is the treatment goal in patient without distressing symptoms of HF. For patients with marked congestion and few symptoms at rest, initial treatment with oral or intravenous (i.v.) digoxin is preferred. For patients in haemodynamic instability, an i.v. bolus of digoxin or amiodarone should be administered. Beta-blockers are the first line therapy in NYHA Class I-III patients with euvolemic state.",

For patients with non-valvular AF NOACs are preferred. But in patients with mechanical heart valves or at least moderate mitral stenosis, only oral vitamin K antagonists should be used (see the table below). Recommendations for the prevention of thrombo-embolism in patients with symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class II–IV) and paroxysmal or persistent/permanent atrial fibrillation Recommendations Classa Levelb The CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores are recommended tools in patients with HF for the estimation of the risk of thrombo-embolism and the risk of bleeding associated with oral anticoagulation, respectively. I B An oral anticoagulant is recommended to prevent thrombo-embolism for all patients with paroxysmal or persistent/permanent AF and a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2, without contra-indications, and irrespective of whether a rate or rhythm management strategy is used (including after successful cardioversion). I A NOAC treatment is contra-indicated in patients with mechanical valves or at least moderate mitral stenosis. III B In patients with AF of ≥ 48 h duration, or when the duration of AF is unknown, an oral anticoagulant is recommended at a therapeutic dose for ≥ 3 weeks prior to electrical or pharmacological cardioversion. I B Intravenous heparin or LMWH and TOE guided strategy is recommended for patients who have not been treated with an anticoagulant dose for ≥3 weeks and require urgent electrical or pharmacological cardioversion for a life threatening arrhythmia. I C Combination of an oral anticoagulant and an antiplatelet agent is not recommended in patients with chronic (>12 months after an acute event) coronary or other arterial disease, because of a high-risk of serious bleeding. Single therapy with an oral anticoagulant is preferred after 12 months. III C For patients with HF and non-valvular AF eligible for anticoagulation based on a CHA2DS2-VASc score, NOACs rather than warfarin should be considered for anticoagulation as NOACs are associated with a lower risk of stroke, intracranial haemorrhage and mortality, which outweigh the increased risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage.

Therefore, all patients with suspected AHF should have a diagnostic workup and appropriate pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment should be started promptly and in parallel. Initial evaluation and continued non-invasive monitoring of the patient’s vital cardiorespiratory functions, including pulse oximetry, blood pressure, respiratory rate and a continuous ECG instituted within minutes, is essential to evaluate whether ventilation, peripheral perfusion, oxygenation, heart rate and blood pressure are adequate. Urine output should also be monitored, although routine urinary catheterization is not recommended. Patients with respiratory distress/failure or haemodynamic compromise should be triaged to a location where immediate respiratory and cardiovascular support can be provided. Recommendations for the management of patients with acute heart failure – oxygen therapy and ventilatory support Recommendations Classa Levelb Monitoring of transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) is recommended. I C Measurement of blood pH and carbon dioxide tension (possibly including lactate) should be considered, especially in patients with acute pulmonary oedema or previous history of COPD using venous blood. In patients with cardiogenic shock arterial blood is preferable. IIa C Oxygen therapy is recommended in patients with AHF and SpO2 <90% or PaO2 <60 mmHg (8.0 kPa) to correct hypoxaemia. I C Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (CPAP, BiPAP) should be considered in patients with respiratory distress (respiratory rate >25 breaths/min, SpO2 <90%) and started as soon as possible in order to decrease respiratory distress and reduce the rate of mechanical endotracheal intubation. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation can reduce blood pressure and should be used with caution in hypotensive patients. Blood pressure should be monitored regularly when this treatment is used. IIa B Intubation is recommended, if respiratory failure, leading to hypoxaemia (PaO2 <60 mmHg (8.0 kPa)), hypercapnia (PaCO2 >50 mmHg (6.65 kPa)) and acidosis (pH <7.35), cannot be managed non-invasively. I C AHF = acute heart failure; BiPAP = bilevel positive airway pressure; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CPAP = continuous positive airway pressure; PaCO2 = partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood; PaO2 = partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood; SpO2 = oxygen saturation. aClass of recommendation. bLevel of evidence.",

Recommendations for the management of patients with acute heart failure – pharmacotherapy Recommendations Classa Levelb Diuretics Intravenous loop diuretics are recommended for all patients with AHF admitted with signs/symptoms of fluid overload to improve symptoms. It is recommended to regularly monitor symptoms, urine output, renal function and electrolytes during use of i.v. diuretics. I C In patients with new-onset AHF or those with chronic, decompensated HF not receiving oral diuretics the initial recommended dose should be 20–40 mg i.v. furosemide (or equivalent); for those on chronic diuretic therapy, initial i.v. dose should be at least equivalent to oral dose. I B It is recommended to give diuretics either as intermittent boluses or as a continuous infusion, and the dose and duration should be adjusted according to patients’ symptoms and clinical status. I B Combination of loop diuretic with either thiazide-type diuretic or spironolactone may be considered in patients with resistant oedema or insufficient symptomatic response. IIb C Vasodilators i.v. vasodilators should be considered for symptomatic relief in AHF with SBP >90 mmHg (and without symptomatic hypotension). Symptoms and blood pressure should be monitored frequently during administration of i.v. vasodilators. IIa B In patients with hypertensive AHF, i.v. vasodilators should be considered as initial therapy to improve symptoms and reduce congestion. IIa B Inotropic agents – dobutamine, dopamine, levosimendan, phosphodiesterase III (PDE III) inhibitors Short-term, i.v. infusion of inotropic agents may be considered in patients with hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg) and/or signs/symptoms of hypoperfusion despite adequate filling status, to increase cardiac output, increase blood pressure, improve peripheral perfusion and maintain end-organ function. IIb C An intravenous infusion of levosimendan or a PDE III inhibitor may be considered to reverse the effect of beta-blockade if beta-blockade is thought to be contributing to hypotension with subsequent hypoperfusion. IIb C Inotropic agents are not recommended unless the patient is sympto- matically hypotensive or hypoperfused because of safety concern. III A Vasopressors A vasopressor (norepinephrine preferably) may be considered in patients who have cardiogenic shock, despite treatment with another inotrope, to increase blood pressure and vital organ perfusion. IIb B It is recommended to monitor ECG and blood pressure when using inotropic agents and vasopressors, as they can cause arrhythmia, myocardial ischaemia, and in the case of levosimendan and PDE III inhibitors also hypotension. I C In such cases intra-arterial blood pressure measurement may be considered. IIb C Thrombo-embolism prophylaxis Thrombo-embolism prophylaxis (e.g. with LMWH) is recommended in patients not already anticoagulated and with no contra-indication to anticoagulation, to reduce the risk of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. I B Other drugs For acute control of the ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation:     a. digoxin and/or beta-blockers should be considered as the first-line therapy.c IIa C b. amiodarone may be considered. IIb B Opiates may be considered for cautious use to relieve dyspnoea and anxiety in patients with severe dyspnoea but nausea and hypopnea may occur.

It needs to be considered that some contra-indications are transient and treatable. While an active infection remains a relative contra- indication to heart transplantation, patients with HIV, hepatitis, Chagas disease and tuberculosis can be considered as suitable candidates provided certain strict management principles are adhered to by the teams. In patients with cancer requiring heart transplantation, a close collaboration with oncology specialists should occur to stratify each patient.

Healthcare professionals play an important role in achieving this lifetime approach in their clinical practice and in the society at large.

When and how to assess risk and prioritize Atherosclerosis is usually the product of a number of risk factors: prevention of CVD in individuals should be adapted to their total CV risk: the higher the risk, the more intense the actions. A systematic approach to CV risk assessment is recommended targeting populations likely at higher CV risk, i.e. with family history of premature CVD, familial hyperlipidaemia, major CV risk factors (such as smoking, high BP, DM or raised lipid levels) or conditions affecting CV risk (kidney, inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, obesity, sedentary habit, cancer therapy, obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome). It is recommended to repeat CV risk assessment every 5 years, and more often for individuals with risks close to thresholds mandating treatment.",

    "text": "4.0.0.0 How to estimate total cardiovascular risk? How to estimate total cardiovascular risk? It is essential for clinicians to be able to assess CV risk rapidly and with sufficient accuracy. This led to the development of the risk chart used in the 1994 Guidelines: Systemic Coronary Risk Estimation (SCORE) chart [The electronic version of SCORE, HeartScore (http://www.HeartScore.org), modified to take HDL-C into account, is therefore more accurate]. SCORE, which estimates the 10-year risk of a first fatal CVD, is recommended for risk assessment and can assist in making logical management decisions, and may help to avoid both under- and over-treatment. Other validated risk estimation systems are useful alternatives. Risk score systems should be used in apparently healthy people and not in individuals automatically at high to very high CV risk, e.g. because of established CV disease (see table Risk categories). The latter require intensive attention to risk factors anyway. The total risk approach allows flexibility; if perfection cannot be achieved with one risk factor, trying harder with others can still reduce risk.",

Within the table find the cell nearest to the person&#039;s systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol. Risk estimates will need to be adjusted upwards as the person approaches the next category. While no threshold is universally applicable, the intensity of advice should increase with increasing risk.

While accepting the simplicity of this approach and that it could be useful in some settings, there is better scientific support for the three targets matched to level of risk. dThis is the general recommendation for those at very high-risk.

Non HDL-C secondary targets of <2.6, <3.4 and <3.8 mmol/L (<100, <130 and <145 mg/dL) are recommended for very high, high and low to moderate risk subjects, respectively. cA view was expressed that primary care physicians might prefer a single general LDL-C goal of 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL). While accepting the simplicity of this approach and that it could be useful in some settings, there is better scientific support for the three targets matched to level of risk. dThis is the general recommendation for those at very high-risk.

A combined strategy is advocated to improve CV health across the population at large from childhood onwards, with specific actions to improve CV health in individuals at increased risk of CVD or with established CVD. Specific chapters are dedicated to a population-based approach to promote healthy environment and healthy life style, including diet, exercise, smoking cessation, avoidance of alcohol abuse. Health care professionals have an important role as advocates of this approach. There is more emphasis on CV risk markers in relevant groups, such as young and older individuals, women, ethnic minorities. Promotion of physical activity and healthy life style in all settings and in all population groups, starting in childhood. Health personnel, caregivers should set an example by following healthy lifestyle, such as not smoking or using tobacco products. Sections on preventive interventions at the individual level are included for patients with specific diseases, including atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease.

A lifetime approach to CV risk is important since both CV risk and prevention are dynamic and continuous as patient age and/or accumulate comorbidities.

Atherosclerosis is usually the product of a number of risk factors: prevention of CVD in individuals should be adapted to their total CV risk: the higher the risk, the more intense the actions should be. Screening is the identification of unrecognized disease or, in this case, of an unknown increased risk of CVD in individuals without symptoms and can be done opportunistically (i.e. when the opportunity arises, e.g. when the individuals are consulting their general practitioner (GP) for some other reason) or systematically (i.e. in the general population as part of a screening programme or in targeted subpopulations such as subjects with a family history of premature CVD or familial hyperlipidaemia). These guidelines recommend a systematic approach to CV risk assessment targeting populations likely to be at higher CV risk. Recommendations for cardiovascular risk assessment Recommendations Classa Levelb Systematic CV risk assessment is recommended in individuals at increased CV risk, i.e. with family history of premature CVD, familial hyperlipidaemia, major CV risk factors (such as smoking, high BP, DM or raised lipid levels) or comorbidities increasing CV risk.

This realization led to the development of the risk chart used in the 1994 Guidelines: Systemic Coronary Risk Estimation (SCORE) chart www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/Practice-tools/CVD-prevention-toolbox/SCORE-Risk-Charts or www.heartscore.org (see following pages). In apparently healthy persons, CV risk in general is the result of multiple, interacting risk factors. This is the basis for the total CV risk approach to prevention. SCORE, which estimates the 10-year risk of a first fatal CVD, is recommended for risk assessment and can assist in making logical management decisions, and may help to avoid both under- and over-treatment. Other validated risk estimation systems are useful alternatives to SCORE. The total risk approach allows flexibility; if perfection cannot be achieved with one risk factor, trying harder with others can still reduce risk. Recommendation for how to estimate cardiovascular risk Recommendation Classa Levelb Total CV risk estimation, using a risk estimation system such as SCORE, is recommended for adults >40 years of age, unless they are automatically categorised as being at high-risk or very high-risk based on documented CVD, DM (>40 years of age), kidney disease or highly elevated single risk factor (Table Risk categories).

Use of the low-risk chart is recommended for the low risk countries, and the high-risk chart for all other European and Mediterranean countries, To estimate a person’s 10-year risk of CV death, find the table for his/her gender, smoking status and (nearest) age. Within the table find the cell nearest to the person’s BP and total cholesterol. Risk estimates will need to be adjusted upwards as the person approaches the next age category. While no threshold is universally applicable, the intensity of advice should increase with increasing risk. The effect of interventions on the absolute probability of developing a CV event increases with an increasing baseline risk; i.e. the number of individuals needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one event decreases with increasing risk. Low to moderate risk persons (calculated SCORE <5%) should be offered lifestyle advice to maintain their low- to moderate-risk status. High-risk persons (calculated SCORE ≥5% and <10%) qualify for intensive lifestyle advice, and may be candidates for drug treatment. Very high-risk persons (calculated SCORE ≥10%): drug treatment is more frequently required. Use of the risk charts should be qualified by knowledge of the following aspects: The charts assist in risk estimation but must be interpreted in the light of the clinician’s knowledge and experience and in view of the factors that may modify the calculated risk (see here). Relative risks may be high in young persons, even if 10-year absolute risks are low, because events usually occur later in life. The relative risk chart or estimating risk age may be helpful in identifying and counselling such persons (see here). In persons >60 years of age these thresholds should be interpreted more leniently, because their age-specific risk is normally around these levels, even when other CV risk factor levels are “normal”. In particular, uncritical initiation of drug treatments of all elderly with risks greater than the 10% threshold should be discouraged. The lower risk in women is explained by the fact that risk is deferred by 10 years–the risk of a 60-year-old woman is similar to that of a 50-year-old man. Ultimately more women than men die of CVD. The charts may be used to give some indication of the effects of reducing risk factors, given that there will be a time lag before risk reduces and that the results of randomized controlled trials in general give better estimates of the benefits of interventions. Those who stop smoking in general halve their risk.",

Energy intake should be limited to the amount of energy needed to maintain (or obtain) a healthy weight; that is, a BMI >20.0 and <25.0 kg/m². In general, when following the rules for a healthy diet, no dietary supplements are needed. Both overweight and obesity are associated with an increased risk of CVD death and all-cause mortality.

More should be done to prevent DM. The multidisciplinary approach is very important. Lifestyle management to aid weight control by sustainable dietary changes and increased PA levels should be central. Intensive management of hyperglycaemia reduces the risk of microvascular complications and, to a lesser extent, risk of CVD. However, targets should be relaxed in the elderly, frail, those with long duration of DM, or those with existing CVD. Intensive treatment of BP in DM, with a target of 140 mmHg systolic reduces the risk of macrovascular and microvascular outcomes. A lower SBP target of 130 mmHg further lessens risks for stroke, retinopathy and albuminuria and should be applied to selected patients. Lipid lowering is a key mechanism to lower CVD risk in both type 2 and type 1 DM. All patients above 40 years of age and selected younger patients at elevated risk are recommended for statin therapy as first line. In DM patients with existing CVD, the use of a sodium-glucose co- transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor substantially lessened CVD and total mortality and HF hospitalisation without major adverse effects.

Regular PA is recommended in all men and women as a lifelong part of lifestyle with at least 150 minutes moderate activity per week or at least 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week or an equivalent combination thereof. Any activity is better than none, more activity is better than some. Population-based interventions are effective in promoting PA. Early childhood education in PA and movement should start at pre-school/ kindergarten. Daily PA at school should be at least 30 minutes, preferably 60 minutes. Good neighbourhoods and safe environment enhances and encourages PA in everyday life.

    "text": "3.0.0.0 What is cardiovascular disease prevention? 3.1.0.0 Definition and rationale Cardiovascular disease (CVD) kills over 4 million people in Europe each year. It kills more women (2.2 million, 55%) than men (1.8 million, 45%), although cardiovascular (CV) deaths before the age of 65 years are more common in men (490 000 vs. 193 000). Prevention is defined as a coordinated set of actions, at the population level or targeted at an individual, aimed at eradicating, eliminating or minimizing the impact of CV diseases and their related disability. CVD remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, despite improvements in outcomes for CVD. More patients are surviving their first CVD event and are at high-risk of recurrences. In addition, the prevalence of some risk factors, notably obesity and diabetes, is increasing. The importance of CVD prevention remains undisputed and should be delivered at different levels: (i) in the general population by promoting healthy lifestyle behaviour; and (ii) at the individual level, in those at moderate to high-risk of CVD or patients with established CVD, by tackling an unhealthy lifestyle (e.g. poor-quality diet, physical inactivity, smoking), and by reducing increased levels of CV risk factors such as increased lipid or blood pressure levels. Prevention is effective in reducing the impact of CVD; the elimination of health risk behaviours would make it possible to prevent at least 80% of CVD and even 40% of cancers, thus providing added value for other chronic diseases.",

Cost-effectiveness depends on several factors,including baseline CV risk, cost of drugs or other interventions, reimbursement procedures, and uptake of preventive strategies. CV = cardiovascular; CVD = cardiovascular disease. Table 3 Suggestions for implementing healthy lifestyles Recommendation Classa Levelb Measures aimed at implementing healthy lifestyles are more cost- effective than drug interventions at the population level. IIa B aClass of recommendation. bLevel of evidence. Considerable evidence has quantified the relative efforts and costs in relation to health impact. The efforts may be depicted in the health impact pyramid (Figure 1), where interventions with the broadest impact on populations represent the base and interventions with considerable individual effort are at the top.

Rationale for assessing total cardiovascular disease risk: All current guidelines on the prevention of CVD in clinical practice recommend the assessment of total CAD or CV risk because atherosclerotic CVD is usually the product of a number of risk factors and prevention of CVD in a given person should be adapted to his or her total CV risk: the higher the risk the more intense the action should be. Simple principles of risk assessment, developed in these guidelines, can be defined as follows: (I) Persons with: documented CVD type 1 or type 2 diabetes very high levels of individual risk factors chronic kidney disease (CKD) are automatically at VERY HIGH or HIGH TOTAL CARDIOVASCULAR RISK. No risk estimation models are needed for them; they all need active management of all risk factors. (2) For all other people, the use of a risk estimation system such as SCORE is recommended to estimate total CV risk because many people have several risk factors which, in combination, may result in unexpectedly high levels of total CV risk. The SCORE system estimates the 10-year cumulative risk of a first fatal atherosclerotic event, whether heart attack, stroke, or other occlusive arterial disease, including sudden cardiac death. Risk estimates have been produced as charts for high and low-risk regions (Figures 2 and 3). All International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes that are related to deaths from vascular origin caused by atherosclerosis are included. Some other systems estimate CAD risk only.",

    "text": "4.1.4.0 Risk chart for CV mortality The reasons for retaining a system that estimates fatal as opposed to total fatal + non-fatal events are that non-fatal events are dependent on definition, developments in diagnostic tests, and methods of ascertainment, all of which can vary, resulting in very variable multipliers to convert fatal to total events. In addition, total event charts, in contrast to those based on mortality, cannot easily be recalibrated to suit different populations. Naturally, the risk of total fatal and non-fatal events is higher, and clinicians frequently ask for this to be quantified. The SCORE data indicate that the total CVD event risk is about three times higher than the risk of fatal CVD for men, so that a SCORE risk of 5% translates approximately into a CVD risk of 15% of total (fatal plus non-fatal) hard CVD endpoints; the multiplier is about four in women and lower in older persons. Clinicians often ask for thresholds to trigger certain interventions. This is problematic since risk is a continuum and there is no threshold at which, for example, a drug is automatically indicated. This is true for all continuous risk factors such as plasma cholesterol or systolic blood pressure. Therefore, the goals that are proposed in this document reflect this concept. A particular problem relates to young people with high levels of risk factors; a low absolute risk may conceal a very high relative risk requiring intensive lifestyle advice. To motivate young people not to delay changing their unhealthy lifestyle, an estimate of their relative risk, illustrating that lifestyle changes can reduce relative risk substantially, may be helpful (Figure 4). Figure 4 Relative risk chart for 10-year cardiovascular mortality Please note that this chart shows RELATIVE not absolute risk.The risks are RELATIVE to 1 in the bottom left.Thus, a person in the top right hand box has a relative risk that is 12 times higher than a person in the bottom left. For interactivity see here Another approach to this problem in young people is to use CV risk age. The risk age of a person with several CV risk factors is the age of a person with the same level of risk but with ideal levels of risk factors. Thus a high-risk 40-year-old may have a risk age of ≥60 years. Risk age is an intuitive and easily understood way of illustrating the likely reduction in life expectancy that a young person with a low absolute but high relative risk of CVD will be exposed to if preventive measures are not adopted. Risk age can be estimated visually by looking at the SCORE chart (as illustrated in Figure 5). In this chart, the risk age is calculated compared with someone with ideal risk factor levels, which have been taken as non-smoking, total cholesterol of 4 mmol/L (155 mg/dL), and systolic blood pressure of 120 mmHg. Risk age is also automatically calculated as part of the latest revision of HeartScore (www.HeartScore.org).",

The electronic version of SCORE, HeartScore, has been modified to take HDL-C into account on a continuous basis which is even better; we recommend its use by using the www.heartscore.org in order to increase the accuracy of the risk evaluation. Overall, HDL cholesterol has a modest but useful effect in refining risk estimation but this may not be universal, as its effect may not be seen in some low-risk populations, particularly with a relatively high mean population HDL level.",

    "text": "4.1.8.0 How to use the risk estimation charts Box 3 How to use the risk estimation charts To estimate a person&#039;s 10-year risk of CVD death, find the table for his/her gender, smoking status, and age. Within the table find the cell nearest to the person&#039;s blood pressure and TC. Risk estimates will need to be adjusted upwards as the person approaches the next age category. Risk is initially assessed on the level of TC and systolic blood pressure before treatment, if known. The longer the treatment and the more effective it is, the greater the reduction in risk, but in general it will not be more than about one-third of the baseline risk. For example, for a person on antihypertensive drug treatment in whom the pre-treatment blood pressure is not known, if the total CV SCORE risk is 6%, then the pre-treatment total CV risk may have been 9%. Low-risk persons should be offered advice to maintain their low-risk status. While no threshold is universally applicable, the intensity of advice should increase with increasing risk. The charts may be used to give some indication of the effects of reducing risk factors, given that there will be a time lag before the risk reduces and that the results of randomized controlled trials in general give better estimates of benefits. In general, those who stop smoking rapidly halve their cumulative risk.",

Risk will be overestimated in countries with a decreasing CVD mortality, and underestimated in countries in which mortality is increasing. This is dealt with by recalibration (www.heartscore.org). Risk estimates appear lower in women than in men. However, risk is only deferred in women; the risk of a 60-year-old woman is similar to that of a 50-year-old man. Ultimately more women die from CVD than men. Relative risks may be unexpectedly high in young persons, even if absolute risk levels are low. The relative risk chart (Figure 4) and the estimated risk age (Figure 5) may be helpful in identifying and counselling such persons.",

Risk factor screening including the lipid profile should be considered in men >40 years old and in women >50 years of age or post-menopausal. A risk estimation system such as SCORE can assist in making logical management decisions, and may help to avoid both under- or over-treatment. Certain individuals declare themselves to be at high or very high CVD risk without needing risk scoring and require immediate attention to all risk factors. This is true for patients with documented CVD, diabetes or CKD. All risk estimation systems are relatively crude and require attention to qualifying statements. Additional factors affecting risk can be accommodated in electronic risk estimation systems such as HeartScore (www.heartscore.org). The total risk approach allows flexibility-if perfection cannot be achieved with one risk factor, risk can still be reduced by trying harder with the others.",

Non-HDL-C or apoB are good surrogate markers of TRLs and remnants and are a secondary objective of therapy. Non-HDL-C <3.4 mmol/L (<130 mg/dL) or apoB <100 mg/dL is desirable in those at high-risk, and <2.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL) and <80 mg/dL, respectively, in those at very high-risk. Increased waist circumference and elevation of TG seems to be a simple tool to capture the high-risk subjects with MetS. Atherogenic dyslipidaemia is one of the major risk factors for CVD in people with type 2 diabetes. apoB = apolipoprotein B; CVD = cardiovascular disease; HDL-C = high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol; LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol; MetS = metabolic syndrome; TG = triglycerides; TRLs = triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Table 25 Recommendations for the treatment of dyslipidaemia in diabetes Recommendations Classa Levelb In all patients with type I diabetes and in the presence of microalbuminuria and/or renal disease, LDL-C lowering (at least 50%) with statins as the first choice is recommended irrespective of the baseline LDL-C concentration.

Before starting lipid-lowering drug treatment, at least two measurements should be made, with an interval of 1-12 weeks, with the exception of conditions where concomitant drug treatment is suggested such as ACS and very high-risk patients. How often should a patient&#39;s lipids be tested after starting lipid-lowering treatment? 8 (±4) weeks after starting treatment. 8 (±4) weeks after adjustment of treatment until within the target range. How often should lipids be tested once a patient has reached the target or optimal lipid level? Annually (unless there is adherence problems or other specific reasons for more frequent reviews). Monitoring liver and muscle enzymes How often should liver enzymes (ALT) be routinely measured in patients on lipid- lowering drugs? Before treatment. Once 8-12 weeks after starting a drug treatment or after dose increase. Routine control of ALT thereafter is not recommended during lipid-lowering treatment. What if liver enzymes become elevated in a person taking lipid-lowering drugs? If ALT <3x ULN: Continue therapy. Recheck liver enzymes in 4-6 weeks. If value rises to ≥3x ULN Stop lipid-lowering therapy or reduce dose and recheck liver enzymes within 4-6 weeks. Cautious reintroduction of therapy may be considered after ALT has returned to normal. If ALT remains elevated check for the other reasons. How often should CK be measured in patients taking lipid-lowering drugs? Pre-treatment. Before starting therapy. If baseline CK is 4x ULN, do not start drug therapy; recheck. Monitoring: Routine monitoring of CK is not necessary. Check CK if patient develops myalgia. Be alert regarding myopathy and CK elevation in patients at risk such as: elderly patients, concomitant interfering therapy, multiple medications, liver or renal disease or sport athletes. What if CK becomes elevated in a person taking lipid-lowering drugs? Re-evaluate indication for statin treatment. If ≥4 x ULN: If CK >10x ULN: stop treatment, check renal function and monitor CK every 2 weeks. If CK <10x ULN: if no symptoms, continue lipid lowering therapy while monitoring CK. If CK <10x ULN: if symptoms present, stop statin and monitor normalization of CK, before re-challenge with a lower statin dose. Consider the possibility of transient CK elevation for other reasons such as exertion. Consider myopathy if CK remains elevated. Consider combination therapy or an alternative drug. If <4 x ULN: If no muscle symptoms, continue statin (patient should be alerted to report symptoms; check CK). If muscle symptoms, monitor symptoms and CK regularly. If symptoms persist, stop statin and re-evaluate symptoms after 6 weeks; re-evaluate indication for statin treatment. Consider re-challenge with the same or another statin. Consider low-dose statin, alternate day or once/twice weekly dosing regimen or combination therapy. For details on CK elevation and treatment of muscular symptoms during statin treatment see algorithm in Figure 8.

Explore motivation and identify ambivalence.Weigh pros and cons for change, assess and build self-efficacy and confidence, avoid circular discussion. 2. Offer support and establish an alliance with the patient and his/her family. 3. Involve the partner, other household members or caregiver who may be influential in the lifestyle of the patient. 4. Use the OARS method (Open-ended questions, Affirmation, Reflective listening, Summarising; http://www.smartrecovery.org/resources/UsingMIinSR.pdf) when discussing behaviour. 5. Tailor advice to an individual patientӳ culture, habits and situation. 6. Use SMART goal setting-egotiate goals for change that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timely. Follow up on goals and record progress on a shared record. In addition, it is important to be aware of the following barriers to change: 1. Healthy choices are not always easy choices. 2. Socioeconomic status and cultural and environmental factors influence behaviour change. 3. Your agenda for change as a health professional may conflict with that of the person you are trying to help. 4. Helping people to change requires dedicated time from the health professional to provide support and follow-up. 5. People may have feelings of ambivalence towards changing behaviour which need exploring.",

    "text": "13.2.0.0 Adhering to medications Elderly patients and those with low socioeconomic status and chronic health conditions may be especially vulnerable. These patients may get confused, especially when their regimens are complex and include many drugs (polypharmacy) that need to be taken on more than one occasion per day. Important steps to empower patients to get more benefit from health interventions include the following: 1. Use good interpersonal skills (good eye contact, warm manner) and an empathetic, non-judgmental attitude. 2. Provide clear and simple instructions on a drug regimen backed up with written instructions, which can also be seen by a spouse or carer. 3. Speak slowly in plain language and avoid medical jargon when giving instructions. 4. Limit the number of instructions to no more than three key points - principle of &#39;need to know&#39; (Figure 9). 5. Use &#39;teachback&#39; to confirm understanding, for example, &#39;I want to make sure that I explained things clearly. Let&#39;s review what we discussed. What are the three strategies that will help keep your cholesterol down?&#39; 6. Use supplemental materials, e.g. images, videos and audio sources, to improve recall. 7. Encourage questions and discussion ֠enlist the family or others important to an individual. 8. Motivational interviewing skills may be helpful in communicating with patients who are ambivalent or seem against starting or continuing with medications: 9. Build self-efficacy and confidence, drawing on social learning theory. Counsel patients using the OARS method (Box 11). Use the &#39;elicit-provide-elicit&#39; model to tailor the information you give (ELICIT what the patient wants to know, PROVIDE that information, ELICIT from the patient how they can use this new knowledge to their benefit). Acknowledge and reflect your patient&#39;s resistance. Support your patient&#39;s autonomy to make their own decisions about their health and treatment. Explore your patient&#39;s ambivalence to adhere to their treatment. f. Develop a plan of action together and share decision making. Figure 9 Prioritising information when educating patients Being able to identify patients with low health literacy is important. Indicators may include seeking help when an illness is already advanced, inarticulacy in explaining concerns, making excuses like &#39;I forgot my glasses&#39; to cover for the shame associated with illiteracy, being over passive or aggressive, and missing appointments. Box 12 lists a number of tips to use when prescribing multiple medications to patients in order to help them adhere. Box 12 Tips to aid adherence to multiple drug therapies 1. &#39;Agree&#39; on rather than ‘dictate’ drug regimen to your patient and tailor it to his/her personal lifestyle and needs. 2. Back up verbal instructions with clear written instructions. 3. Simplify the dosing regimen and consider a fixed dose combination pill where available. 4. Perform a regular review of medicines to minimize polypharmacy (or ask the pharmacist to assist). 5. Encourage self-monitoring and use cues and technologies to act as reminders. 6. Provide information on common side effects and discuss management strategies. 7. Involve the partner, other family members or the caregiver in the patient&#39;s treatment.",

Definition and classification Based on population estimates from 2015, in the region of 1 400 000 and 2 200 000 patients per year may have an indication for DAPT after coronary intervention or myocardial infarction (MI), respectively in Europe. In 2017, it is the 21st anniversary of the publication of the first randomized clinical trial establishing the superiority of DAPT over anticoagulant therapy among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (Figure 1). Based on over 35 randomized clinical trials, including more than 225 000 patients, DAPT is among the most intensively investigated treatment options in the field of cardiovascular medicine (Figure 1). Figure 1 History of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients with coronary artery disease The size of the circles denotes sample size. The colours of perimeters identify the type of included patient populations within each study. The colours within each circle identify the antiplatelet agent(s) investigated.

Risk scores Given the trade-‍off between ischaemic vs. bleeding risks for any given DAPT duration, the use of scores might prove useful to tailor DAPT duration in order to maximize ischaemic protection and minimize bleeding risks in the individual patient. The use of risk scores, which were specifically designed to guide and inform decision-‍making on DAPT duration, should be prioritized over other available risk scores (Table 3). The table below provides an overview for the risk scores, which have been validated for dual antiplatelet therapy duration decision-‍making Table 3 Risk scores validated for dual antiplatelet therapy duration decision making PRECISE-‍DAPT score Time of use At the time of coronary stenting DAPT duration strategies assessed Short DAPT (3–6 months) vs. Standard/‍long DAPT (12–24 months) Score calculationa Score range 0 to 100 points Decision making cut-‍off suggested Score ≥25 → Short DAPT Score <25 → Standard/‍long DAPT Calculator www.precisedaptscore.com DAPT score Time of use After 12 months of uneventful DAPT DAPT duration strategies assessed Standard DAPT (12 months) vs. Long DAPT (30 months) Score calculationa Age   ≥75 –2 pt 65 to <75 –1 pt <65 0 pt Cigarette smoking +1 pt Diabetes mellitus +1 pt MI at presentation +1 pt Prior PCI or prior MI +1 pt Paclitaxel-‍eluting stent +1 pt Stent diameter <3 mm +1 pt CHF or LVEF <30% +2 pt Vein graft stent +2 pt Score range –2 to 10 points Decision making cut-‍off suggested Score ≥2 → Long DAPT Score <2 → Standard DAPT Calculator www.daptstudy.org CHF = congestive heart failure; CrCl = dual antiplatelet therapy; Hb = haemoglobin; LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction; MI = myocardial infarction; PCI = percutaneous coronary intervention; PRECISE-‍DAPT = PREdicting bleeding Complications In patients undergoing Stent implantation and subsEquent Dual Anti Platelet Therapy; WBC = white blood cell count. aFor the PRECISE-‍DAPT score use the score nomogram: mark patient’s value for each of the five clinical variables of the score and draw a vertical line to the ‘Point’ axis to determine the number of points obtained for each clinical variable.Then summate the points obtained for each clinical variable to the total score. A practical case example for score calculation is provided in Web Figure 1 of the Web Addenda (www.escardio.org/guidelines).

    "text": "3.0.0.0 Introduction The term “peripheral arterial diseases” (PADs) encompasses all arterial diseases other than coronary arteries and the aorta. This should be clearly distinguished from the term “peripheral artery disease” often used to name lower extremity artery disease (LEAD). Indeed, other peripheral localizations (Figure 1) are also frequently affected, mainly by atherosclerosis, and complete the family of PADs. Because of multiple presentations and therapeutic options, a multidisciplinary management of these patients is mostly necessary, and cardiologists should be sensitive in regard to the diagnosis and management of patients with PADs, as many of them are seen and managed for concomitant cardiac conditions. Major efforts are still necessary to sensitize healthcare providers, decision makers and the general population about the need for awareness, screening, prevention and management of the 40 million individuals in our continent affected by PADs. General recommendations on the management of patients with peripheral arterial diseases Recommendations Classa Levelb In healthcare centres, it is recommended to set up a multidisciplinary Vascular Team to make decisions for the management of patients with PADs. I C It is recommended to implement and support initiatives to improve medical and public awareness of PADs, especially cerebrovascular and lower extremity artery diseases.

Epidemiology and risk factors The risk of different localizations of PADs increases with age and with exposure to major CV risk factors: smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes. The strength of association between each risk factor and each vascular territory is variable. When a vascular territory is affected by atherosclerosis, not only is the corresponding organ endangered (e.g. the brain for carotid artery disease) but also the total risk of any cardiovascular event is increased (e.g. coronary events).",

Careful inspection of upper extremities, including hands (i.e. colour, skin integrity). Palpation of upper extremity pulses. Blood pressure measurement of both arms and notation of inter-‍arm difference. Auscultation at different levels including the flanks, peri-‍umbilical region, and groin. Abdominal palpation, palpation of femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial artery pulses, temperature gradient assessment. Careful inspection of lower limbs, including feet (i.e. colour, presence of any cutaneous lesion). Findings suggestive of lower extremity arterial disease, including calf hair loss and muscle atrophy, should be noted. Peripheral neuropathy assessment in case of diabetes or LEAD: sensory loss (monofilament testing), ability to detect pain and light touch (sharp examination pin, cotton wool), vibration impairment (128 Hz tuning fork); deep tendon reflexes examination; sweating.",

Patients with clinical suspicion for LEAD: Lower extremities pulse abolition and/‍or arterial bruit Typical intermittent claudication or symptoms suggestive for LEAD Non-‍healing lower extremity wound Patients at risk for LEAD because of the following clinical conditions: Atherosclerotic diseases: CAD, any PADs Other conditions: AAA, CKD, heart failure Asymptomatic individuals clinically-free but at-‍risk for LEAD: Men and women aged >65 years Men and women aged <65 years classified at high CV risk according the ESC Guidelinesa Men and women aged >50 years with family history for LEAD 2. How to measure the ABI? In supine position, with cuff placed just above the ankle, avoiding wounded zones. After a 5–10 minute rest, the SBP is measured by a Doppler probe (5–10 MHz) on the posterior and the anterior tibial (or dorsal pedis) arteries of each foot and on the brachial artery of each arm. Automated BP cuffs are mostly not valid for ankle pressure and may display overestimated results in case of low ankle pressure. The ABI of each leg is calculated by dividing the highest ankle SBP by the highest arm SBP. 3. How to interpret the ABI? For diagnosis of LEAD interpret each leg separately (one ABI per leg). For the CV risk stratification: take the lowest ABI between the two legs. Interpretation: AAA = abdominal aorta aneurysm; ABI = ankle-‍brachial index; BP = blood pressure; CAD = coronary artery disease; CKD = chronic kidney disease; CV = cardiovascular; ESC = European Society of Cardiology; LEAD = lower extremity artery disease; PADs = peripheral arterial diseases; SBP = systolic blood pressure. aSubjects with: markedly elevated single risk factors; diabetes mellitus (except for young people with type 1 diabetes without other major risk factors); a calculated SCORE ≥5% and <10%.

    "text": "4.0.0.0 General comments 4.1.0.0 Overview The aims of the evaluation of patients with VHD are to diagnose, quantify, and assess the mechanism of VHD as well as its consequences. Decision-making for intervention should be made by a “Heart Team” with a particular expertise in VHD, comprising cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, imaging specialists, anaesthetists, and if needed, general practitioners, geriatricians, and heart failure, electrophysiology or intensive care specialists. The “Heart Team” approach is particularly advisable in the management of high-‍risk patients and is also important for other subsets, such as asymptomatic patients where the evaluation of valve reparability is a key component in decision-‍making. The essential questions in the evaluation of a patient for valvular intervention are summarized in Table 3. Table 3 Essential questions in the evaluation of patients for valvular intervention Questions How severe is VHD? What is the aetiology of VHD? Does the patient have symptoms? Are symptoms related to valvular disease? Are any signs present in asymptomatic patients that indicate a worse outcome if the intervention is delayed? What are the patient’s life expectancya and expected quality of life? Do the expected benefits of intervention (versus spontaneous outcome) outweigh its risks? What is the optimal treatment modality? Surgical valve replacement (mechanical or biological), surgical valve repair, or catheter intervention? Are local resources (local experience and outcome data for a given intervention) optimal for the planned intervention? What are the patient’s wishes? VHD = valvular heart disease. aLife expectancy should be estimated according to age, sex, comorbidities, and country-‍specific life expectancy.",

    "text": "4.2.0.0 pt evaluation 4.2.1.0 Overview Precise evaluation of the patient’s history and symptomatic status as well as proper physical examination, in particular auscultation and search for heart failure signs, are crucial for the diagnosis and management of VHD. In addition, assessment of the extracardiac condition – comorbidities and general condition – require particular attention. Echocardiography is the key technique to diagnose VHD and to assess its aetiology, severity, mechanisms, pathophysiologic consequences (cardiac chamber size, ventricular function, pulmonary artery pressure) and prognosis. Other non-‍invasive investigations such as stress testing, CMR, CT, fluoroscopy, and biomarkers are complementary, and invasive investigation beyond preoperative coronary angiography is restricted to situations where non-‍invasive evaluation is inconclusive. Echocardiographic criteria for the definition of severe valve stenosis are indicated in the corresponding sections, and quantification of regurgitant lesions is summarized in Table 4. An integrated approach including various criteria is strongly recommended instead of referring to single measurements. Indications for coronary angiography are summarized in the Table “Management of CAD in patients with VHD”.",

Most experience relates to surgery and TAVI. While EuroSCORE I markedly overestimates 30-day mortality and should therefore be replaced by the better performing EuroSCORE II with this regard, it is nevertheless provided in this document for comparison as it has been used in many TAVI studies/ registries and may still be useful to identify the subgroups of patients for decision between intervention modalities and to predict 1-year mortality. Both scores have, however, major limitations for practical use by insufficiently considering disease severity and not including major risk factors such as frailty, porcelain aorta, chest radiation etc. It remains essential not to rely on a single risk score figure when assessing patients, nor to determine unconditionally the indication and type of intervention. Patient’s life expectancy, expected quality of life, and patient preference should be considered, as well as local resources and results. The futility of interventions in patients unlikely to benefit from the treatment has to be taken into consideration, particularly for TAVI and mitral edge-‍to-‍ edge repair.

Essential aspects of this evaluation include: Assessment of valve morphology: tricuspid, bicuspid, unicuspid, or quadricuspid valve. Determination of the direction of the AR jet in the long-‍axis view (central or eccentric) and its origin in the short-‍axis view (central or commissural). Identification of the mechanism, following the same principle as for MR: normal cusps but insufficient coaptation due to dilatation of the aortic root with central jet (type 1); cusp prolapse with eccentric jet (type 2); retraction with poor cusp tissue quality and large central or eccentric jet (type 3). Quantification of AR should follow an integrated approach considering all qualitative, semiquantitative, and quantitative parameters (Table 4). Measurement of LV function and dimensions. Indexing LV diameters for body surface area (BSA) is recommended in patients with small body size (BSA <1.68 m2). New parameters obtained by three-‍dimensional (3D) echocardiography, tissue Doppler, and strain rate imaging may be useful, particularly in patients with borderline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) where they may help in the decision for surgery. Measurement of the aortic root and ascending aorta in the 2-‍dimensional (2D) mode at four levels: annulus, sinuses of Valsalva, sinotubular junction, and tubular ascending aorta. Measurements are taken in the parasternal long- axis view from leading edge to leading edge at end diastole except forthe aortic annulus, which is measured in mid systole. As it will have surgical consequences, it is of importance to differentiate three phenotypes of the ascending aorta:1) aortic root aneurysms (sinuses of Valsalva >45 mm); 2) tubular ascending aneurysm (sinuses of Valsalva <40–45 mm); 3) isolated AR (all diameters <40 mm). The calculation of indexed values has been recommended to account for body size. Definition of the anatomy of the aortic valve cusps and assessment of valve reparability should be provided by preoperative TOE if aortic valve repair or a valve-‍sparing surgery of the aortic root is considered. CMR should be used to quantify regurgitant fraction when echocardiographic measurements are equivocal. In patients with aortic dilatation, gated MSCT is recommended to assess the maximum diameter. CMR can be used for follow-‍up but indication for surgery should preferably be based on CT measurements.",

TOE provides additional evaluation of concomitant mitral valve abnormalities. It has gained importance in the assessment before TAVI and after TAVI or surgical procedures. MSCT and CMR provide additional information on the dimensions and geometry of the aortic root and ascending aorta and the extent of calcification. MSCT has become particularly important for the quantification of valve calcification when assessing AS severity in low-‍gradient AS. CMR may be useful for the detection and quantification of myocardial fibrosis, providing additional prognostic information regardless of the presence of CAD. Natriuretic peptides have been shown to predict symptom-‍free survival and outcome in normal and low-‍flow severe AS, and may be useful in asymptomatic patients to determine optimal timing of intervention. Retrograde LV catheterization to assess the severity of AS is no longer routinely performed. Its use is restricted to patients with inconclusive non- invasive investigations. Diagnostic work-‍up before transcatheter aortic valve implantation: MSCT is the preferred imaging tool to assess anatomy and dimensions of the aortic root, size and shape of the aortic valve annulus, its distance to the coronary ostia, the distribution of calcifications, and the number of aortic valve cusps. It is essential to evaluate the feasibility of the various access routes as it provides information on minimal luminal diameters, atherosclerotic plaque burden, presence of aneurysms or thrombi, vessel tortuosity, and thoracic and LV apex anatomy. CMR–as an alternative technique–is, in this context, inferior to MSCT with regards to assessment of inner vessel dimensions and calcifications. 3D TOE can be used to determine aortic annulus dimensions but remains more operator-‍ and image-‍ quality–dependent than MSCT.",

I B Intervention is indicated in symptomatic patients with severe low-‍flow, low-‍gradient (<40 mmHg) aortic stenosis with reduced ejection fraction, and evidence of flow (contractile) reserve excluding pseudosevere aortic stenosis. I C Intervention should be considered in symptomatic patients with low-flow, low-‍gradient (<40 mmHg) aortic stenosis with normal ejection fraction after careful confirmation of severe aortic stenosisc (see Figure 2 and Table 6). IIa C Intervention should be considered in symptomatic patients with low- flow, low-‍gradient aortic stenosis and reduced ejection fraction without flow (contractile) reserve, particularly when CT calcium scoring confirms severe aortic stenosis. IIa C Intervention should not be performed in patients with severe comorbidities when the intervention is unlikely to improve quality of life or survival. III C b) Choice of intervention in symptomatic aortic stenosis Aortic valve interventions should only be performed in centres with both departments of cardiology and cardiac surgery on-‍site, and with structured collaboration between the two, including a Heart Team (heart valve centres). I C The choice for intervention must be based on careful individual evaluation of technical suitability and weighing of risks and benefits of each modality (aspects to be considered are listed in Table 7). In addition, the local expertise and outcomes data for the given intervention must be taken into account. I C SAVR is recommended in patients at low surgical risk (STS or EuroSCORE II <4% or logistic EuroSCORE I <10%d and no other risk factors not included in these scores, such as frailty, porcelain aorta, sequelae of chest radiation). I B TAVI is recommended in patients who are not suitable for SAVR as assessed by the Heart Team. I B In patients who are at increased surgical risk (STS or EuroSCORE II ≥4% or logistic EuroSCORE I ≥10%d or other risk factors not included in these scores such as frailty, porcelain aorta, sequelae of chest radiation), the decision between SAVR and TAVI should be made by the Heart Team according to the individual patient characteristics (see Table 7), with TAVI being favoured in elderly patients suitable for transfemoral access. I B Balloon aortic valvotomy may be considered as a bridge to SAVR or TAVI in haemodynamically unstable patients or in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who require urgent major non-‍cardiac surgery. IIb C Balloon aortic valvotomy may be considered as a diagnostic means in patients with severe aortic stenosis and other potential cause for symptoms (i.e. lung disease) and in patients with severe myocardial dysfunction, pre-renal insufficiency or other organ dysfunction that may be reversible with balloon aortic valvotomy when performed in centres that can escalate to TAVI. IIb C c) Asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis (refers only to patients eligible for surgical valve replacement) SAVR is indicated in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis and systolic LV dysfunction (LVEF <50%) not due to another cause. I C SAVR is indicated in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis and abnormal exercise test showing symptoms on exercise clearly related to aortic stenosis. I C SAVR should be considered in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis and abnormal exercise test showing fall in blood pressure below baseline. IIa C SAVR should be considered in asymptomatic patients with normal ejection fraction and none of the above-‍mentioned exercise test abnormalities if the surgical risk is low and one of the following findings is present: Very severe aortic stenosis defined by a Vmax >5.5 m/s Severe valve calcification and a rate of Vmax progression ≥ 0.3 m/s/year Markedly elevated BNP levels (>threefold age- and sex-‍corrected normal range) confirmed by repeated measurements without other explanations Severe pulmonary hypertension (systolic pulmonary artery pressure at rest >60 mmHg confirmed by invasive measurement) without other explanation. IIa C d) Concomitant aortic valve surgery at the time of other cardiac/ ascending aorta surgery SAVR is indicated in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing CABG, or surgery of the ascending aorta or of another valve.

It has also been suggested that if age is <70 years and, more importantly, an average rate of AS progression of 5 mmHg per year is documented, patients may benefit from valve replacement at the time of coronary surgery once the baseline peak gradient exceeds 30 mmHg. Individual judgement is recommended, taking into consideration BSA, haemodynamic data, leaflet calcification, AS progression rate, patient life expectancy and associated comorbidities, as well as the individual risk of either concomitant valve replacement or late reoperation. Patients with severe symptomatic AS and diffuse CAD that cannot be revascularized should not be denied SAVR or TAVI. Combined PCI and TAVI has been shown to be feasible, but requires more data before a firm recommendation can be made. The chronology of interventions should be the subject of individualized discussion based on the patient’s clinical condition, extent of CAD, and myocardium at risk. When MR is associated with severe AS, its severity may be overestimated in the presence of the high ventricular pressures, and careful quantification is required. As long as there are no morphological leaflet abnormalities (flail or prolapse, post-‍rheumatic changes, or signs of infective endocarditis), mitral annulus dilatation, or marked abnormalities of LV geometry, surgical intervention on the mitral valve is in general not necessary.

A precise anatomical description of the lesions, using the segmental and functional anatomy according to the Carpentier classification, should be performed to assess the feasibility of repair.

Determination of functional capacity and symptoms assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing may be useful in asymptomatic patients. Exercise echocardiography is useful to quantify exercise-induced changes in MR, in systolic pulmonary artery pressure, and in LV function. It may be particularly helpful in patients with symptoms and uncertainty about the severity of MR based on measurements at rest. The use of global longitudinal strain could be of potential interest for the detection of subclinical LV dysfunction but is limited by inconsistent algorithms used by different echo systems. Neurohormonal activation is observed in MR, with a potential value of elevated BNP levels and a change in BNP as predictors of outcome (particularly of symptom onset). In particular, low plasma BNP has a high negative predictive value and may be helpful in the follow-‍up of asymptomatic patients.

In secondary TR, the degree of dilatation of the annulus, the RV dimension and function, and the degree of tricuspid valve deformation should be measured. Evaluation of TR severity (integration of multiple qualitative and quantitative parameters) and pulmonary systolic pressure should be carried out as currently recommended (Table 4). It has to be noted that the problem of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance may be disguised in the presence of severe TR because its velocity may be lower than expected in the case of pulmonary hypertension. Evaluations of the RV dimensions and function should be conducted, despite existing limitations of current indices of RV function.

Disease of multiple valves may be encountered in several conditions, particularly in rheumatic and congenital heart disease but also, less frequently, in degenerative valve disease. There is a lack of data on combined or multiple valve diseases. This does not allow for evidence-‍based recommendations. The general principles for the management of combined or multiple valve disease are as follows: When either stenosis or regurgitation is predominant, management follows the recommendations concerning the predominant VHD. When the severity of both stenosis and regurgitation is balanced, indications for interventions should be based on symptoms and objective consequences rather than on the indices of severity of stenosis or regurgitation. In this setting, consideration of the pressure gradient that reflects the haemodynamic burden of the valve lesion becomes more important than valve area and measures of the regurgitation for the assessment of disease severity. It is necessary to take into account the interaction between the different valve lesions. Indications for intervention are based on global assessment of the consequences of the different valve lesions (i.e. symptoms or presence of LV dilatation or dysfunction). Intervention can be considered for non-‍severe multiple lesions associated with symptoms or leading to LV impairment. The decision to intervene on multiple valves should take into account the extra surgical risk of combined procedures. The choice of surgical technique should take into account the presence of the other VHD; repair remains the ideal option. The management of specific associations of VHD is detailed in the individual sections of this document.",

For the sake of immediate treatment strategies such as reperfusion therapy, it is usual practice to designate patients with persistent chest discomfort or other symptoms suggestive of ischaemia and ST-‍segment elevation in at least two contiguous leads as STEMI.",

    "text": "3.3.0.0 Epidemiology of STEMI Worldwide, ischaemic heart disease is the single most common cause of death and its frequency is increasing. However, in Europe there has been an overall trend for a reduction in ischaemic heart disease mortality during the past three decades. Ischaemic heart disease now accounts for almost 1.8 million annual deaths, or 20% of all deaths in Europe, although with large variations between countries. The relative incidences of STEMI are decreasing and NSTEMI are increasing. There is a consistent pattern for STEMI to be relatively more common in younger than in older people, and more common in men than in women. Several recent studies have highlighted a fall in acute and long-‍term mortality following STEMI in parallel with greater use of reperfusion therapy, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), modern antithrombotic therapy, and secondary prevention. Still, mortality remains substantial: the in-‍hospital mortality of unselected patients with STEMI in the national registries of the ESC countries varies between 4% and 12%, while reported one-‍year mortality among STEMI patients in angiography registries is approximately 10%. Although ischaemic heart disease develops on average 7–10 years later in women compared with men, myocardial infarction remains a leading cause of death in women. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) occurs three to four times more often in men than in women below the age of 60, but after the age of 75, women represent the majority of patients. There is an ongoing debate on whether outcomes are poorer in women, with several studies indicating that a poorer outcome is related to older age and more comorbidities among women suffering myocardial infarction. Some studies have indicated that women tend to undergo fewer interventions than men and receive reperfusion therapy less frequently. These guidelines aim to highlight the fact that women and men receive equal benefit from a reperfusion strategy and STEMI-‍related therapy, and both genders must be managed in a similar fashion.",

    "text": "5.0.0.0 Emergency care 5.1.0.0 Initial diagnosis Management – including diagnosis and treatment – of STEMI starts from the point of first medical contact (FMC). It is recommended to establish a regional reperfusion strategy to maximize efficiency. A working diagnosis of STEMI (called the “STEMI diagnosis” throughout this document) must first be made. This is usually based on symptoms consistent with myocardial ischaemia (i.e. persistent chest pain) and signs (i.e. 12-lead ECG). When a STEMI is suspected, a 12-lead ECG must be acquired and interpreted as soon as possible at the time of FMC to facilitate early STEMI diagnosis and triage. In patients with a clinical suspicion of myocardial ischaemia and ST-‍segment elevation, reperfusion therapy needs to be initiated as soon as possible. ECG criteria are based on changes of electrical currents of the heart (measured in miliVolts). Standard calibration of the ECG is 10mm/mV. Therefore 0.1 mV equals to 1 mm square on the vertical axis. For simplicity, in this document ECG deviations are expressed in mm following the standard calibration. In the proper clinical context, ST-‍segment elevation (measured at the J-‍point) is considered suggestive of ongoing coronary artery acute occlusion in the following cases: ≥2 contiguous leads with ST-‍segment elevation ≥2.5 mm in men <40 years, ≥2 mm in men ≥40 years, or ≥1.5 mm in women in leads V2 –V3 and/‍or ≥1 mm in the other leads. In patients with inferior myocardial infarction, it is recommended to record right precordial leads (V3R and V4R) seeking ST-‍segment elevation, to identify concomitant right ventricular (RV) infarction. Likewise, ST-‍segment depression in leads V1–V3 suggests myocardial ischaemia, especially when the terminal T-‍wave is positive (ST-‍segment elevation equivalent), and confirmation by concomitant ST-‍segment elevation ≥0.5 mm recorded in leads V7 –V9 should be considered as a means to identify posterior myocardial infarction. The presence of a Q wave on the ECG should not necessarily change the reperfusion strategy decision. Blood sampling for serum markers is routinely carried out in the acute phase. This is indicated, but should not delay the reperfusion strategy/treatment. If in doubt regarding the possibility of acute evolving myocardial infarction, emergency imaging aids the provision of timely reperfusion therapy to these patients. Recommendations for initial diagnosis Recommendations Classa Levelb ECG monitoring 12-lead ECG recording and interpretation is indicated as soon as possible at the point of FMC, with a maximum target delay of 10 min. I B ECG monitoring with defibrillator capacity is indicated as soon as possible in all patients with suspected STEMI. I B The use of additional posterior chest wall leads (V7–V9) in patients with high suspicion of posterior myocardial infarction (circumflex occlusion) should be considered. IIa B The use of additional right precordial leads (V3R and V4R) in patients with inferior myocardial infarction should be considered to identify concomitant RV infarction. IIa B Blood sampling Routine blood sampling for serum markers is indicated as soon as possible in the acute phase but should not delay reperfusion treatment.

Table 3 Atypical electrocardiographic presentations that should prompt a primary percutaneous coronary intervention strategy in patients with ongoing symptoms consistent with myocardial ischaemia Bundle branch block Criteria that can be used to improve the diagnostic accuracy of STEMI in LBBB: Concordant ST-‍segment elevation ≥1 mm in leads with a positive QRS complex Concordant ST-‍segment depression ≥1 mm in V1–V3 Discordant ST-‍segment elevation ≥5 mm in leads with a negative QRS complex The presence of RBBB may confound the diagnosis of STEMI. Ventricular paced rhythm During RV pacing, the ECG also shows LBBB and the above rules also apply for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction during pacing; however, they are less specific. Isolated posterior myocardial infarction Isolated ST depression ≥0.5 mm in leads V1–V3 and ST-‍segment elevation (≥0.5 mm) in posterior chest wall leads V7–V9. Ischaemia due to left main coronary artery occlusion or multivessel disease ST depression ≥1 mm in eight or more surface leads, coupled with ST-‍segment elevation in aVR and/‍or V1, suggests left main-, or left main equivalent-‍ coronary obstruction, or severe three vessel ischaemia.

As this arrhythmia frequently occurs at an early stage, these deaths usually happen out of hospital. In patients following cardiac arrest and ST-‍segment elevation on the ECG, primary PCI is the strategy of choice. Given the high prevalence of coronary occlusions and potential difficulties in interpreting the ECG in patients after cardiac arrest, urgent angiography (within 2 hours) should be considered in survivors of cardiac arrest, including unresponsive survivors, having a high index of suspicion of ongoing infarction (such as the presence of chest pain before arrest, history of established CAD, and abnormal or uncertain ECG results). However, in patients without ST-‍segment elevation, a quick evaluation at the emergency department or intensive cardiac care unit to exclude non-‍coronary causes and to perform an urgent echocardiography is reasonable. Unfavourable pre-hospital settings indicating a remote likelihood for neurological recovery should be strongly considered and argued against an invasive coronary strategy. Prevention and improved treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is crucial for reducing the mortality related to CAD.

    "text": "5.4 Prehospital logistics To minimize patient delay, it is recommended to increase public awareness of how to recognize common symptoms of AMI and to call the emergency services. All components of the system delay represent the quality of care and it is recommended to measure them as quality indicators. System delay is more readily modifiable by organizational measures than is patient delay, and it is a predictor of outcomes. When STEMI diagnosis is made in the pre-‍hospital setting (EMS), activation of the catheterization laboratory not only reduces treatment delays but may also reduce patient mortality. Optimal treatment of STEMI should be based on implementation of networks between hospitals. The goal of these networks is to provide optimal care while minimizing delays, thereby improving clinical outcomes. Cardiologists should actively collaborate with all stakeholders, particularly emergency physicians, in establishing such networks. The main features of such a network are: Clear definition of geographic areas of responsibility. Shared written protocols. Pre-hospital triage of STEMI patients to the appropriate institution, bypassing non-‍PCI hospitals or hospitals without a 24/7 primary PCI programme. On arrival at the appropriate hospital, the patient should immediately be taken to the catheterization laboratory, bypassing the emergency department. Patients presenting to a non–PCI-‍capable hospital and awaiting transportation for primary or rescue PCI must be attended in an appropriate monitored and staffed area. If the diagnosis of STEMI has not been made by the ambulance crew, and the ambulance arrives at a non–PCI-‍capable hospital, the ambulance should await the diagnosis and, if a STEMI diagnosis is made, should continue to a PCI-‍capable hospital. Logistics of pre-hospital care Recommendations Classa Levelb It is recommended that the pre-hospital management of STEMI patients is based on regional networks designed to deliver reperfusion therapy expeditiously and effectively, with efforts made to make primary PCI available to as many patients as possible. I B It is recommended that primary PCI-‍capable centres deliver a 24/7 service and are able to perform primary PCI without delay.

An experienced team includes not only interventional cardiologists but also skilled support staff. The extent to which the PCI-‍related time delay diminishes the advantages of PCI over fibrinolysis has been widely debated. There is a lack of contemporaneous data to set the limit to choose PCI over fibrinolysis. For simplicity, an absolute time (120 min) from STEMI diagnosis to PCI-‍mediated reperfusion (i.e. wire crossing of the infarct-‍related artery (IRA)) rather than a relative PCI-‍related delay over fibrinolysis has been chosen. If the reperfusion strategy is fibrinolysis, the goal is to inject the bolus of fibrinolytic within 10 min from STEMI diagnosis. Table 4 Definitions of terms related to reperfusion therapy Term Definition FMC The time point when the patient is either initially assessed by a physician, paramedic, nurse or other trained EMS personnel who can obtain and interpret the ECG, and deliver initial interventions (e.g. defibrillation).

In the presence of contra-‍indications for fibrinolytic treatment it is important to weigh the potentially lifesaving effect of fibrinolysis against potentially life-‍threatening side effects taking into account alternative treatment options such as delayed primary PCI. If trained medical or paramedical staff are able to analyse the ECG on-‍site or to transmit the ECG to the hospital for interpretation, it is recommended to initiate fibrinolytic therapy in the pre-hospital setting. The aim is to start fibrinolytic therapy within 10 min from STEMI diagnosis. Following initiation of lytic therapy, it is recommended to transfer the patients to a PCI centre. In cases of failed fibrinolysis, or if there is evidence of reocclusion or reinfarction with recurrence of ST-‍segment elevation, immediate angiography and rescue PCI is indicated. Re-‍administration of fibrinolysis should be discouraged. Even if it is likely that fibrinolysis will be successful, a strategy of routine early angiography (2-24h after fibrinolysis) is recommended if there are no contraindications.

The demonstration of non-‍obstructive CAD in a patient presenting with symptoms suggestive of ischaemia and ST-‍segment elevation or equivalent does not preclude an atherothrombosis aetiology. MINOCA is a working diagnosis and should lead the treating physician to investigate underlying causes. The identification of the underlying cause of MINOCA should lead to specific treatment strategies. Although the outcome of MINOCA strongly depends on the underlying cause, its overall prognosis is serious, with a 1-year mortality of about 3.5%. Table 10 Diagnostic criteria for myocardial infarction with non- obstructive coronary arteries The diagnosis of MINOCA is made immediately upon coronary angiography in a patient presenting with features consistent with an AMI, as detailed by the following criteria: (1) Universal AMI criteria. (2)Non-‍obstructive coronary arteries on angiography, defined as no coronary artery stenosis ≥50% in any potential IRA. (3) No clinically overt specific cause for the acute presentation. AMI = acute myocardial infarction; IRA = infarct-‍related artery; MINOCA = myocardial infarction with non-‍obstructive coronary arteries. Figure 7 Diagnostic test flowchart in MINOCA CMR = Cardiac Magnetic Resonance; IVUS = IntraVascular UltraSound; LV = Left Ventricle; MINOCA = Myocardial Infarction with Non-‍Obstructed Coronary Arteries; OCT = Optical Coherence Tomography; STEMI = ST segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction; TOE = Trans-‍Oesofageal Echocardiography; TTE = Trans-‍Thoracic Echocardiography. Takotsubo syndrome cannot be diagnosed with certainty in the acute phase as the definition requires follow up imaging to document recovery of left ventricular function. IVUS and OCT frequently show more atherosclerotic plaque than may be appreciated on angiography.They also increase sensitivity for dissection. If intracoronary imaging is to be performed, it is appropriate to carry out this imaging at the time of the acute cardiac catheterization, after diagnostic angiography. Patients should be made aware of the additional information the test can provide and the small increase in risk associated with intracoronary imaging. 1Provocative testing for coronary artery spasm might be considered in selected patients with a recent AMI with suspected vasospastic angina. Provocative manoeuvres have to be always performed by operators with experience and not necessarily in the acute phase of STEMI. 2Clinically suspected myocarditis by ESC Task Force criteria = No angiographic stenosis ≥50% plus non ischemic pattern on CMR. Definite myocarditis by ESC Task Force criteria = No angiographic stenosis ≥50% plus endomyocardial biopsy confirmation (histology, immunohistology, polymerase-‍chain reaction based techniques to search for genome of infectious agents, mainly viruses).

Quality indicators are intended to measure and compare the quality of health-‍service provision and serve as a foundation for quality improvement initiatives. Table 11 Quality indicators Type of indicator and process Quality indicator Structural measures (organization) 1) The centre should be part of a network specifically developed for the rapid and efficient management of STEMI patients with written protocols covering the following points: Single emergency telephone number for patients to contact the emergency services Pre-hospital interpretation of the ECG for diagnosis and strategy decision Pre-hospital activation of the catheterization laboratory Transportation (ambulance-‍helicopter) equipped with ECG defibrillators. 2) Key times to reperfusion are systematically recorded and periodically reviewed for quality assessments by the centre or network participants. Performance measures for reperfusion therapy 1) Proportion of STEMI patients arriving in the first 12 h receiving reperfusion therapy. 2) Proportion of patients with timely reperfusion therapy, defined as: For patients attended to in the pre-‍hospital setting: <90 min from STEMI diagnosis to IRA wire crossing for reperfusion with PCI <10 min from STEMI diagnosis to lytic bolus for reperfusion with fibrinolysis For patients admitted to PCI centres: <60 min from STEMI diagnosis to IRA wire crossing for reperfusion with PCI For transferred patients: <120 min from STEMI diagnosis to IRA wire crossing for reperfusion with PCI <30 min door-‍in-‍door-‍out for patients presenting in a non- PCI centre (en route to a PCI centre) Performance measures for risk assessment in hospital 1) Proportion of patients having LVEF assessed before discharge.

Patient-‍reported outcomes Availability of a programme to obtain feedback regarding the patient’s experience and quality of information received, including the following points: Angina control. Explanations provided by doctors and nurses (about the disease, benefit/risk of discharge treatments, and medical follow-‍up). Discharge information regarding what to do in case of recurrence of symptoms and recommendation to attend a rehabilitation programme (including smoking cession and diet counselling). Outcome measures 1) 30-day adjusted mortality (e.g. GRACE risk score-adjusted). 2) 30-day adjusted readmission rates.

    "text": "ESC Task Force has selected 19 simple rules to guide the diagnosis and management of syncope patients with TLOC according to the 2018 ESC guidelines on syncope:   Diagnosis: initial evaluation At the initial evaluation answer the following 4 key questions: Was the event TLOC? In case of TLOC, is it of syncopal or non-syncopal origin? In case of suspected syncope, is there a clear aetiological diagnosis? Is there evidence to suggest a high risk of cardiovascular events or death? At the evaluation of TLOC in the ED answer the following 3 key questions: Is there a serious underlying cause that can be identified? If the cause is uncertain, what is the risk of a serious outcome? Should the patient be admitted to hospital? In all patients, perform a complete history taking, physical examination (including standing BP measurement) and standard ECG. Perform immediate ECG monitoring (in bed or telemetry) in high-‍risk patients when there is a suspicion of arrhythmic syncope. Perform an echocardiogram when there is previous known heart disease or data suggestive of structural heart disease or syncope secondary to cardiovascular cause. Perform CSM in patients >40 years of age with syncope of unknown origin compatible with a reflex mechanism. Perform tilt testing in case there is suspicion of syncope due to reflex or an orthostatic cause. Perform blood tests when clinically indicated, e.g. haematocrit and cell blood count when haemorrhage is suspected, oxygen saturation and blood gas analysis when hypoxic syndromes are suspected, troponin when cardiac-‍ischaemia related syncope is suspected, D-‍dimer when pulmonary embolism is suspected, etc. Diagnosis: subsequent investigations Perform prolonged ECG monitoring (external or implantable) in patients with recurrent severe unexplained syncope who: have clinical or ECG features suggesting arrhythmic syncope; and have a high probability of recurrence of syncope in a reasonable time; and may benefit a specific therapy if a cause for syncope is found. Perform EPS in patients with unexplained syncope and bifascicular BBB (impending high degree AV block) or suspected tachycardia. Perform an exercise stress test in patients who experience syncope during or shortly after exertion. Consider basic autonomic function tests (Valsalva manoeuvre and deep breathing test) and ABPM for assessment of autonomic function in patients with suspected neurogenic OH. Consider video recording (at home or in hospital) of TLOC suspected of non-syncopal nature. Treatment To all patients with reflex syncope and OH, explain the diagnosis, reassure, explain the risk of recurrence, and give advice on how to avoid triggers and situations. These measures are the cornerstone of treatment and have a high impact in reducing the recurrence of syncope. In patients with severe forms of reflex syncope, select one or more of the following additional specific treatments according to the clinical features: Midodrine or fludrocortisone in young patients with low BP phenotype; Counter-‍pressure manoeuvres (including tilt training if needed) in young patients with prodromes; ILR-‍guided management strategy in selected patients without or with short prodromes; Discontinuation/‍reduction of hypotensive therapy targeting a systolic BP of 140 mmHg in old hypertensive patients; Pacemaker implantation in old patients with dominant cardioinhibitory forms. In patients with OH, select one or more of the following additional specific treatments according to clinical severity: Education regarding lifestyle manoeuvres; Adequate hydration and salt intake; Discontinuation/‍reduction of hypotensive therapy; Counter-‍pressure manoeuvres; Abdominal binders and/‍or support stockings; Head-‍up tilt sleeping; Midodrine or fludrocortisone. Ensure that all patients with cardiac syncope receive the specific therapy of the culprit arrhythmia and/‍or of the underlying disease. Balance benefit and harm of an ICD implantation in patients with unexplained syncope at high risk of SCD (e.g. those affected by left ventricle systolic dysfunction, HCM, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, or inheritable arrhythmogenic disorders). In this situation, unexplained syncope is defined as syncope that does not meet any Class I diagnostic criterion defined in the tables of recommendations of the 2018 ESC guidelines on syncope and is considered a suspected arrhythmic syncope. Re-‍evaluate the diagnostic process and consider alternative therapies if the above rules fail or are not applicable to an individual patient. Bear in mind that guidelines are only advisory. Even though they are based on the best available scientific evidence, treatment should be tailored to an individual patient’s need.",

    "text": "Clinicians responsible for managing patients with TLOC must frequently make treatment decisions without adequate evidence or a consensus of expert opinion. The following is a short list of selected, common issues that deserve to be addressed in future clinical research.   Diagnosis – gap between the best available scientific evidence and the need for dissemination of these concepts into clinical practice There is wide variation in practice of syncope evaluation, and wide variation in adoption of recommendations from published guidelines. The absence of a systematic approach to TLOC incurs higher health and social care costs, unnecessary hospitalizations and diagnostic procedures, prolongation of hospital stays, lower diagnostic rates, and higher rates of misdiagnoses and symptom recurrences. Therefore, there is a need for: Despite the recommendation from the ESC guidelines on syncope, syncope units are not widely established in clinical practice. Barriers to establishing a syncope unit include lack of resources, lack of trained dedicated staff, and complex presentations to multiple settings, necessitating involvement from multiple disciplines. The evidence for usefulness of syncope units is controversial. Therefore, there is a need for: Large clinical studies that assess the diagnostic yield and compliance of a guideline-‍based standardized systematic approach Large clinical studies that test the superiority of management in a dedicated syncope facility versus conventional management   Diagnosis – need for new diagnostic tests and devices BP recording is crucial for the majority of clinical TLOC situations and will add important information for treatment of syncope. Unfortunately, current long-‍term BP (or surrogate) recording systems are not optimal for diagnostic use in the syncope evaluation setting. Therefore, there is a need for: Development and validation of new diagnostic multiparametric devices that can record heart rhythm and BP (and possibly other physiological parameters such as cerebral saturation or EEG) at the time of a syncopal event.   Treatment – lack of evidence of efficacy of most available therapies Only a few small randomized controlled trials have been done on treatment of syncope. In addition, syncopal recurrences are unpredictable and often decrease spontaneously after medical assessment, even in the absence of a specific therapy. The consequence of the spontaneous decrease is that any therapy for syncope prevention appears to be more effective than it actually is and makes the results of observational data on therapy questionable in the absence of a control group. No therapy can be effective for all patients. Any therapy should be assessed in homogeneous subgroups. Therefore, there is strong urgent need of randomized controlled clinical trials on the efficacy of: Pharmacological therapies targeted to specific subgroups of reflex syncope. Pacemaker therapy targeted to specific subgroups of cardioinhibitory reflex syncope. Pharmacological therapies of OH-‍mediated syncope. ICD therapy targeted to specific subgroups of patients with unexplained syncope at risk of SCD.   Treatment – need for new therapies There is the need to move towards personalized medicine. Improving the knowledge of the biochemical mechanisms underlying specific forms of reflex syncope will allow the development of new therapies in such specific settings. For example, a low adenosine phenotype and a low norepinephrine phenotype have been recently identified. Therefore, there is a need for: Syncope is a transient phenomenon. The ideal therapy should be that is administered only when needed. Therefore, there is a need for: Randomized clinical trials on the efficacy of theophylline (and other xantine antagonists) for low adenosine syncope and norepinephrine transport inhibitors for low epinephrine syncope. Randomized clinical trials of on-‍demand administration of specific therapy based on specific sensors similar to adrenalin injectors in asthma or nasal spray for paroxysmal SVT.",

    "text": "Risk estimation should be individualized depending on the underlying cardiac diagnosis, ventricular and valvular function, functional class, presence of cyanosis, PAPs, and other factors. Indications for intervention (surgical or catheter) in the majority of patients do not differ in women who consider pregnancy compared with other patients. There are a few exceptions, such as some degree of aortic dilatation and severe asymptomatic MS. In women with a moderate or high-‍risk of complications during pregnancy (mWHO II–III, III, and IV), pre-‍pregnancy counselling and management during pregnancy and around delivery should be performed in an expert centre by a multidisciplinary team: the pregnancy heart team. All women with congenital or other possibly genetic heart disease should be offered foetal echocardiography in weeks 19–22 of pregnancy. A delivery plan should be made between 20–30 weeks of pregnancy detailing induction, management of labour, delivery, and post-‍partum surveillance. Induction of labour should be considered at 40 weeks of gestation in all women with cardiac disease. Vaginal delivery is the first choice for the majority of patients. Indications for caesarean section are: pre-‍term labour in patients on OACs aggressive aortic pathology acute intractable HF severe forms of PH (including Eisenmenger’s syndrome) Pregnancy termination should be discussed if there is a high-‍risk of maternal morbidity or mortality, and/‍or of foetal abnormality. Pregnancy, and consequently fertility treatment, is contraindicated in women with mWHO class IV. All patients with known cardiac or aortic disease need investigations and counselling about the risks of pregnancy pre-‍pregnancy or before assisted reproductive therapy. The following patients should be counselled against pregnancy: with a Fontan operation and additional comorbidities (ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias, or valve regurgitation with PAH severe systemic ventricular dysfunction (EF <30% or NYHA class III–IV). severe (re-)coarctation systemic right ventricle with moderate or severely decreased ventricular function with vascular Ehlers-‍Danlos with severe aortic dilatation or (history of) aortic dissection with severe MS (even when asymptomatic) Patients with severe AS who are symptomatic, or asymptomatic patients with impaired LV function or a pathological exercise test if LVEF does not normalize in women with previous PPCM. Women with a mechanical valve prosthesis are at high-‍risk of maternal morbidity (especially valve thrombosis and bleeding) and even mortality and should be managed by a pregnancy heart team in expert centres. LMWH should only be used when weekly monitoring of anti-‍Xa levels with dose adjustment is available. Women with HF during pregnancy should be treated according to current guidelines for non-‍pregnant patients, respecting contraindications for some drugs in pregnancy (see table of Recommendations for drug use in pregnancy). When inotropes or more advanced treatment is necessary, transport to an expert centre is recommended. It is recommended to inform women with DCM and HFrEF about the risk of deterioration of the condition during gestation and peripartum. In women with PPCM and DCM, subsequent pregnancy is not recommended if LVEF does not normalize. Patients with congenital LQTS and catecholaminergic polymorphic VT are recommended beta-‍blockers during pregnancy and post-‍partum. Initiation of antihypertensive drug treatment is recommended in all women with persistent elevation of BP ≥150/95 mmHg and at values >140/90 mmHg in women with: gestational hypertension (with or without proteinuria) pre-‍existing hypertension with the superimposition of gestational hypertension hypertension with subclinical organ damage or symptoms at any time during pregnancy. Women at high or moderate risk of pre-‍eclampsia should be advised to take 100–150 mg of acetylsalicylic acid daily from week 12 to week 36–37 in addition to their hypertension treatment. Methyldopa, labetalol, and calcium antagonists are recommended for the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy. LMWH is the agent of choice for VTE prophylaxis and treatment. Thrombolytics to treat thrombo-‍embolism should only be used in patients with severe hypotension or shock. In the case of an emergency, drugs that are not recommended by the pharmaceutical industry during pregnancy and breastfeeding should not be withheld from the mother. The potential risk of a drug and the possible benefit of the therapy must be weighed against each other.",

    "text": "Epidemiological data European epidemiological (e.g. registers such as ROPAC) data on women with CVDs and their outcomes, and the foetal risk during pregnancy and in the peripartum period, are important sources ofinformation. However, there is also a clear need for randomized controlled trials. In women with specific aortic diseases, the outcome is not well studied and the impact of treatment with beta-‍blockers during pregnancy is lacking. The impact of pregnancy in a woman with congenital or aortic disease on the long-‍term maternal and foetal outcome is not well studied. The impact of fertility treatment on pregnancy complications and maternal outcomes remains unknown.   Mechanical valve prostheses In women with mechanical valve prostheses, no prospective studies are available that compare different anticoagulation regimens. There are unresolved questions concerning LMWH, including optimal anti-‍Xa levels, the importance of peak vs. pre-‍dose levels, the best time intervals for anti-‍Xa monitoring, and the duration of use (first trimester or throughout pregnancy).   Coronary artery disease In women with CAD, the required delay of a subsequent pregnancy following MI is unknown. Furthermore, optimal management and follow-‍up of patients with P-‍SCAD is a burning clinical problem. This includes the decision for interventional therapy as well as counselling on the recurrence risk for repeated pregnancies.   Drugs The safety of antiplatelet agents used after PCI in pregnancy is not well known. There is a lack of randomized trials on the use of antiarrhythmic drugs and interventions during pregnancy. Data based on prospective randomized clinical trials in pregnant women to assess drug efficacy and safety are very limited. They will stay limited in some areas due to accepted ethical limitations. However, greater efforts can be made by prospective registries to answer burning treatment questions. Studies investigating the pharmacokinetic changes during pregnancy that modify clinical drug efficacy are required.   Cardiomyopathies The pathophysiology of PPCM has still to be explored in more detail. PPCM includes LV dysfunction due to several different causes and thus PPCM is not a well-‍described entity. The potential for recovery is often unclear and the risks of subsequent pregnancies are not well defined. For acute HF in the context of pregnancy there are almost no evidence-‍based treatments. More research is clearly needed.   Cardiac transplantation Evidence is also limited for pregnancies in patients post-‍cardiac transplantation.   Delivery Trials evaluating the level of surveillance at delivery and the warranted monitoring level after delivery are needed. Furthermore, the optimal mode of delivery is not clear for high-‍risk situations.   Hypertension It is still unclear whether mild–moderate hypertension in pregnancy should be pharmacologically treated. The current guidelines are based on expert consensus regarding thresholds to initiate antihypertensive medication. Prospective studies, even observational, in this area are needed.   Diagnostic pathways More data are needed on diagnostic pathways, specifically the place of D-‍dimers, in VTE. The value of monitoring anti-‍Xa values in patients with VTE (treatment) is unknown. Studies are needed on the benefit of using the combination of peak and trough levels. The lack of data regarding the length of anticoagulation after delivery is an unmet need.",

    "text": "Myocardial revascularization is performed for the relief of symptoms of myocardial ischaemia and the improvement of prognosis. In SCAD, the prognostic benefit is dependent on the extent of myocardium subject to ischaemia. The prognostic and symptomatic benefits of myocardial revascularization critically depend on the completeness of revascularization. Therefore, the ability to achieve complete revascularization is a key issue when choosing the appropriate treatment strategy. Apart from issues of individual operative risk and technical feasibility, diabetes mellitus and the anatomical complexity of CAD determine the relative benefits of PCI and CABG. The SYNTAX score is the recommended tool to gauge the anatomical complexity of coronary disease. In some instances, both PCI and CABG are equally reasonable, or sometimes even equally problematic, options. This calls for the Heart Team to be consulted to develop individualized treatment concepts, with respect for the preferences of the patient who has been informed about early and late outcomes. Timely PCI of the culprit lesion remains the mainstay of treatment of ACS. After PCI of the culprit lesion in ACS, the choice of further revascularization modality should follow the criteria applied to patients with SCAD. Radial access is preferred for any PCI irrespective of clinical presentation, unless there are overriding procedural considerations. DES are recommended for any PCI irrespective of clinical presentation, lesion type, anticipated duration of DAPT, or concomitant anticoagulant therapy. Even though 6 months of DAPT is generally recommended after PCI in SCAD and 12 months of DAPT after ACS, the type and duration of DAPT should be individualized according to the ischaemic and bleeding risks, and appropriately adapted during follow-‍up. Based on this judgement, treatment durations for DAPT after DES that are as short as 1 month or even as long as lifelong may be reasonable. Off-‍pump surgery with no-‍touch aorta for high-‍risk patients should be considered when expertise exists. Multiple arterial grafting should be considered using the radial artery for high-‍grade stenosis and/‍or BIMA grafting for patients who do not have an increased risk of sternal wound infection.",

    "text": "Diagnostic tools to guide myocardial revascularization Further studies investigating the role of novel, combined, non-‍invasive anatomical and functional imaging are needed, such as randomized clinical trials with CT-‍FFR in patients with suspected and known CAD, as well as further clinical investigation of perfusion CT. Randomized trials comparing iwFR-‍based management of patients with intermediate-‍grade stenosis compared with medical therapy are missing. Further study of whole-‍cardiac cycle Pd/Pa for the guidance of revascularization in the setting of randomized clinical trials is also required. Further studies including randomized trials are needed to assess the value of functional vs. anatomical guidance for CABG.   Revascularization for stable coronary artery disease Revascularization for stable coronary artery disease It remains to be determined whether revascularization by PCI improves prognosis in patients with SCAD. The ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches) study (NCT01471522) is currently recruiting 5000 patients with SCAD and evidence of moderate-‍to severe ischaemia detected by non-‍invasive imaging, who are randomized before coronary angiography to medical therapy or an invasive strategy to detect differences in the primary endpoint of death or MI. Current techniques rely on coronary angiography and the detection of ischaemia-producing lesions. However, future adverse events are related at least in part to non-‍flow limiting, vulnerable plaques. Better identification of vulnerable plaques and the development of appropriate treatment strategies is needed. Along the same lines, the completeness and timing of revascularization are not well defined, and neither are the roles of residual ischaemia and lesions. Moreover, we need more research on the use of the SYNTAX and other scores for informing treatment allocation, as well as dedicated trials in specific subsets. Very long-‍term, extended follow-‍up (10 years) of trials comparing PCI and CABG, particularly in the setting of LM disease, will provide further insights into the relative merits of both revascularization techniques.   Revascularization in non-‍ST-‍elevation acute coronary syndrome In the setting of NSTE-‍ACS, there are no dedicated prospective studies on the revascularization strategy with multivessel disease. Thus, current recommendations on the choice of lesions to be treated and treatment modality (PCI or CABG) are based on an analogy to findings obtained in SCAD or STEMI. Likewise, the prognostic role of FFR and iwFR in guiding myocardial revascularization needs additional clarification.   Revascularization in ST-‍segment elevation myocardial infarction Patients undergoing primary PCI benefit from full revascularization, but the optimal timing of treatment of the non-‍culprit lesion is not known. More studies evaluating the assessment of non-‍culprit lesions by FFR or iwFR at the time of acute PCI, and studies investigating whether intravascular imaging guidance of primary PCI can improve the outcomes of STEMI patients, are needed. Future trials of improved thrombus aspiration technologies may address the role of this strategy in patients with high-‍risk features, such as large thrombus Burden.   Myocardial revascularization in patients with heart failure There is no RCT comparing revascularization with PCI vs. CABG in patients with HF. There is limited evidence on the role of active MCS in patients with cardiogenic shock compared with standard therapy.   Revascularization in patients with diabetes Following successful revascularization, the rate of events during follow-‍up remains high in patients with diabetes, independent of the mode of revascularization. Future research should be focused on identifying new disease-‍ modifying therapies to influence the progression of vascular disease in this high-‍risk cohort.   Revascularization in patients with chronic kidney disease Thus far, patients with CKD have been excluded from randomized trials on myocardial revascularization, hence current data are based on observational studies only. A randomized trial on optimal long-‍term revascularization strategies in patients with moderate-‍to-severe stress-‍induced ischaemia and severe CKD is currently ongoing (ISCHEMIA-‍CKD, https://clinicaltrials.gov/‍ct2/‍show/‍NCT01985360).Moreover, additional randomized evidence on optimal strategies for CIN prevention is needed.   Revascularization in patients requiring valve interventions In patients with concomitant valvular and coronary disease, the possibility of future transcatheter therapy for the aortic and mitral valves has made a significant impact on decision-‍making for patients with predominantly coronary disease with moderate valve lesions. However, there is currently little evidence on this topic. The need for and timing of PCI in patients undergoing TAVI is also an area with limited evidence. The long-‍term outcomes of patients with concomitant surgical repair of ischaemic MR is also awaited.   Arrhythmias The duration of anticoagulation and their combination with antiplatelet therapy in patients with new-‍onset AF after PCI or CABG has not been studied sufficiently. Likewise, the role of routine left atrial exclusion at surgery for the prevention of stroke is currently unclear.   Procedural aspects of coronary artery bypass grafting The role of FFR and iwFR in guiding surgical revascularization needs further investigation into whether it improves clinical outcomes. Likewise, there are insufficient data on the impact of intraoperative assessment of graft flow on outcomes. In view of the limitations of observational studies comparing BIMA with SIMA and the limitations of the ART trial, the ROMA (Randomization of Single vs. Multiple Arterial Grafts) trial is recruiting to answer the question of whether the use of additional arterial conduits (either BIMA or radial artery) translates into superior clinical outcomes when compared with SIMA supplemented by SVG only. Hybrid procedures, which combine minimally invasive arterial grafting with PCI, proved feasible and safe. However, multicentre studies are required to prove the efficacy and superiority of this approach in stable, multivessel coronary disease.   Antithrombotic treatments The value of pre-‍hospital pre-‍treatment with prasugrel in STEMI patients, as well as the safety and efficacy of ticagrelor given at hospital admission in NSTE-‍ACS patients, has not been addressed in dedicated randomized studies. The safety and efficacy of short-‍term potent antiplatelet treatment with either prasugrel or ticagrelor in SCAD patients is unknown, and is subject to ongoing clinical trials [the ALPHEUS (Assessment of Loading With the P2Y12 Inhibitor Ticagrelor or Clopidogrel to Halt Ischemic Events in Patients Undergoing Elective Coronary Stenting) trial: NCT02617290 and the SASSICAIA (Comparison of Loading Strategies With Antiplatelet Drugs in Patients Undergoing Elective Coronary Intervention) trial: NCT02548611].The clinical benefit of a short-‍term DAPT duration followed by long-‍term ticagrelor monotherapy (and stopping aspirin) remains unknown. The ongoing GLOBAL LEADERS (Long-‍term ticagrelor monotherapy versus standard dual antiplatelet therapy followed by aspirin monotherapy in patients undergoing biolimus-‍eluting stent implantation) and TWILIGHT (Ticagrelor With Aspirin or Alone in High-‍Risk Patients After Coronary Intervention) trials aim to close this gap in our current knowledge (NCT01813435 and NCT02270242, respectively).   Medical therapy, secondary prevention, and strategies for follow-‍up In all studies to date on the optimal follow-‍up after PCI, the gain from discovering patients with restenosis is obscured by the high rate of false positive exercise ECG tests indicating ischaemia. Therefore, simple exercise ECG testing is not recommended for follow-‍up and a non-‍invasive imaging approach is preferred. Specific studies to clarify which subset of patients benefits more from a specific follow-‍up approach are missing. More studies are needed to assess the role of CT angiography in patient surveillance after myocardial revascularization.",

    "text": "BP, epidemiology, and risk. Globally, over 1 billion people have hypertension. As populations age and adopt more sedentary lifestyles, the worldwide prevalence of hypertension will continue to rise towards 1.5 billion by 2025. Elevated BP is the leading global contributor to premature death, accounting for almost 10 million deaths in 2015, 4.9 million due to ischaemic heart disease and 3.5 million due to stroke. Hypertension is also a major risk factor for heart failure, AF, CKD, PAD, and cognitive decline. Definition of hypertension. The classification of BP and the definition of hypertension is unchanged from previous European Guidelines and is defined as an office SBP ≥140 and/‍or DBP ≥90 mmHg, which is equivalent to a 24 h ABPM average of ≥130/80 mmHg, or a HBPM average ≥135/85mmHg. Screening and diagnosis of hypertension. Hypertension is usually asymptomatic (hence the term ‘silent killer’). Because of its high prevalence, screening programmes should be established to ensure that BP is measured in all adults at least every 5 years, and more frequently in people with a high–normal BP. When hypertension is suspected because of an elevated screening BP, the diagnosis of hypertension should be confirmed either by repeated office BP measurements over a number of visits or by out-of-office BP measurement using 24 h ABPM or HBPM. The importance of cardiovascular risk assessment and detection of HMOD. Other CV risk factors such as dyslipidaemia and metabolic syndrome frequently cluster with hypertension. Thus, unless the patient is already at high or very high risk due to established CVD, formal CV risk assessment is recommended using the SCORE system. However, it is important to recognise that the presence of HMOD, especially LVH, CKD, or advanced retinopathy, further increases the risk of CV morbidity and mortality, and should be screened for as part of risk assessment in hypertensive patients because the SCORE system alone may underestimate their risk. Think: could this patient have secondary hypertension? For most people with hypertension, no underlying cause will be detected. Secondary (and potentially remediable) causes of hypertension are more likely to be present in people with young onset of hypertension (<40 years), people with severe or treatment resistant hypertension, or people who suddenly develop significant hypertension in midlife on a background of previously normal BP. Such patients should be referred for specialist evaluation. Treatment of hypertension: importance of lifestyle interventions. The treatment of hypertension involves lifestyle interventions and drug therapy. Many patients with hypertension will require drug therapy, but lifestyle interventions are important because they can delay the need for drug treatment or complement the BP-‍lowering effect of drug treatment. Moreover, lifestyle interventions such as sodium restriction, alcohol moderation, healthy eating, regular exercise, weight control, and smoking cessation all have health benefits beyond their impact on BP. When to consider drug treatment of hypertension. The treatment thresholds for hypertension are now less conservative than they were in previous Guidelines. We now recommend that patients with low-‍moderate-‍risk grade 1 hypertension (office BP 140–159/90–99), even if they do not have HMOD, should now receive drug treatment if their BP is not controlled after a period of lifestyle intervention alone. For higher-‍risk patients with grade 1 hypertension, including those with HMOD, or patients with higher grades of hypertension (e.g. grade 2 hypertension, ≥160/100 mmHg), we recommend initiating drug treatment alongside lifestyle interventions. These recommendations apply to all adults aged <80 years. Special considerations in frail and older patients. It is increasingly recognised that biological rather than chronological age, as well as consideration of frailty and independence, are important determinants of the tolerability of and likely benefit from BP-‍lowering medications. It is important to note that even in the very old (i.e. >80 years), BP-‍lowering therapy reduces mortality, stroke, and heart failure. Thus, these patients should not be denied treatment or have treatment withdrawn simply on the basis of age. For people >80 years who have not yet received treatment for their BP, treatment is recommended when their office SBP is ≥160 mmHg, provided that the treatment is well tolerated. How low should SBP be lowered? This has been a hotly debated topic. A key discussion point is the balance of potential benefits vs. potential harm or adverse effects. This is especially important whenever BP targets are lowered, as there is a greater potential for harm to exceed benefit. Thus, in these Guidelines, we recommend a target range. The evidence strongly suggests that lowering office SBP to <140 mmHg is beneficial for all patient groups, including independent older patients. There is also evidence to support targeting SBP to 130 mmHg for most patients, if tolerated. Even lower SBP levels (<130 mmHg) will be tolerated and potentially beneficial for some patients, especially to further reduce the risk of stroke. SBP should not be targeted to <120 mmHg because the balance of benefit vs. harm becomes concerning at these levels of treated SBP. BP targets in old and very old patients. As discussed above, independence, frailty, and comorbidities will all influence treatment decisions, especially in older (≥65 years) and very old (>80 years) patients. The desired SBP target range for all patients aged >65 years is 130–139 mmHg. This is lower than in previous Guidelines and may not be achievable in all older patients, but any BP lowering towards this target is likely to be beneficial provided that the treatment is well tolerated. BP targets in patients with diabetes and/‍or CKD. The BP treatment targets for patients with diabetes or kidney disease have been a moving target in previous Guidelines because of seemingly contradictory results from major outcome trials and meta analyses. For diabetes, targeting the SBP to <140 mmHg and towards 130 mmHg, as recommended for all other patient groups, is beneficial on major outcomes. Moreover, targeting SBP to <130 mmHg, for those who will tolerate it, may further reduce the risk of stroke but not other major outcomes. SBP should not be <120 mmHg. For patients with CKD, the evidence suggests that the target BP range should be 130–139 mmHg. How low should DBP be lowered? The optimal DBP target has been less well defined, but a DBP target of <80 mmHg is recommended. Some patients with stiff arteries and isolated systolic hypertension will already have DBP levels below this target. These are high-‍risk patients and the low DBP should not discourage treatment of their elevated SBP to the recommended target, provided that treatment is well tolerated. The need to do better on BP control. A key message in these Guidelines is the need to do better at improving BP control rates. Despite the overwhelming evidence of treatment benefit, on average, <50% of patients with treated hypertension achieve an SBP target of <140 mmHg. Physician inertia (inadequate uptitration of treatment, especially from monotherapy) and poor patient adherence to treatment (especially when based on multiple pills) are now recognised as the major factors contributing to poor BP control. Start treatment in most patients with two drugs, not one. Monotherapy is usually inadequate therapy for most people with hypertension; this will be especially true now that the BP treatment targets for many patients are lower than in previous Guidelines. These Guidelines have set out to normalize the concept that initial therapy for the majority of patients with hypertension should be with a combination of two drugs, not a single drug. The only exception would be in a limited number of patients with a lower baseline BP close to their recommended target, who might achieve that target with a single drug, or in some frailer old or very old patients in whom more gentle reduction of BP may be desirable. Evidence suggests that this approach will improve the speed, efficiency, and consistency of initial BP lowering and BP control, and is well tolerated by patients. A single-‍pill strategy to treat hypertension. Poor adherence to longer-‍term BP-‍lowering medication is now recognised as a major factor contributing to poor BP control rates. Research has shown a direct correlation between the number of BP-‍lowering pills and poor adherence to medications. Moreover, SPC therapy has been shown to improve adherence to treatment. SPC therapy is now the preferred strategy for initial two-‍drug combination treatment of hypertension and for three-‍drug combination therapy when required. This will control the BP of most patients with a single pill and could transform BP control rates. A simplified drug treatment algorithm. We have simplified the treatment strategy so that patients with uncomplicated hypertension and many patients with a variety of comorbidities (e.g. HMOD, diabetes, PAD, or cerebrovascular disease) receive similar medication. We recommend a combination of an ACE inhibitor or ARB with a CCB or thiazide/thiazide-‍like diuretic as initial therapy for most patients. For those requiring three drugs, we recommend a combination of an ACE inhibitor or ARB with a CCB and a thiazide/thiazide-‍like diuretic. We recommend that beta-‍blockers be used when there is a specific indication for their use (e.g. angina, post-‍myocardial infarction, HFrEF, or when heart rate control is required). Hypertension in women and in pregnancy. In women with hypertension who are planning pregnancy, ACE inhibitors or ARBs and diuretics should be avoided, and the preferred medications to lower BP, if required, include alpha-‍methyl dopa, labetalol, or CCBs. The same drugs are suitable if BP lowering is required in pregnant women. ACE inhibitors or ARBs should not be used in pregnant women. Is there a role for device-‍based therapy for the treatment of hypertension? A number of device-‍based interventions have been developed and studied for the treatment of hypertension. To date, the results from these studies have not provided sufficient evidence to recommend their routine use. Consequently, the use of device-‍based therapies is not recommended for the routine treatment of hypertension, unless in the context of clinical studies and RCTs, until further evidence regarding their safety and efficacy becomes available.. Managing cardiovascular disease risk in hypertensive patients beyond BP: statins. For hypertensive patients at moderate CVD risk or higher, or those with established CVD, BP lowering alone will not optimally reduce their risk. These patients would also benefit from statin therapy, which further reduces the risk of a myocardial infarction by approximately one-‍third and stroke by approximately one-‍quarter, even when BP is controlled. Similar benefits have been seen in hypertensive patients at the border between low and moderate-‍risk. Thus, many more hypertensive patients would benefit from statin therapy than are currently receiving this treatment. Managing cardiovascular disease risk in hypertensive patients beyond BP: antiplatelet therapy. Antiplatelet therapy, especially low-‍dose aspirin, is recommended for secondary prevention in hypertensive patients, but is not recommended for primary prevention (i.e. in patients without CVD).",

    "text": "1. Diagnosis Clinical probability is the basis of all diagnostic strategies for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) and should systematically be assessed either by clinical judgement or by a validated prediction rule. Plasma D-dimer measurement, preferably using a highly sensitive assay, is recommended in outpatients and in the emergency department to reduce the need for unnecessary imaging and irradiation. A normal computed tomographic (CT) angiography safely excludes PE in patients with low or intermediate clinical probability, or PE-unlikely, while CT angiography showing a segmental or more proximal thrombus confirms PE. A normal perfusion lung scan excludes PE, and a high probability ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan confirms PE; in case of a non-diagnostic V/Q lung scan, PE may be excluded if proximal compression venous ultrasonography (CUS) is negative and the clinical probability is low or PE-unlikely.   2. Prognostic assessment At the stage of clinical suspicion of PE, haemodynamically unstable patients with shock or hypotension should immediately be identified as high-risk patients. Normotensive patients in Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) Class ≥III or a simplified (s)PESI of ≥1 constitute an intermediate-risk group. Of these, patients who have both evidence of RV dysfunction (by echocardiography or CT angiography) and elevated cardiac biomarker levels in the circulation should be classified into an intermediate-high-risk category and monitored for early detection of haemodynamic decompensation. A PESI Class I or II, or a sPESI of 0, indicates a low risk of an early adverse outcome.   3. Acute phase treatment Primary reperfusion treatment, particularly systemic thrombolysis, is the treatment of choice for patients with high-risk PE. Unfractionated heparin with aPTT monitoring is the prefered anticoagulation regimen in such patients For most cases of acute PE without haemodynamic compromise, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux is the initial treatment of choice unless there is severe renal dysfunction. Systemic thrombolysis is not routinely recommended as primary treatment for patients with intermediate-high risk PE, but should be considered if clinical signs of haemodynamic decompensation appear; percutaneous catheter-directed treatment or surgical pulmonary embolectomy are alternative rescue procedures for intermediate-high-risk PE. The new oral anticoagulants (NOACs; direct inhibitors of factor Xa or thrombin) are non-inferior in terms of efficacy and possibly safer, particularly in terms of major bleeding, than the standard anticoagulation regimen consisting of heparin followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). Low-risk patients in the PESI Class I or II, and probably those with sPESI of 0, should be considered for early discharge and outpatient treatment, if this appears feasible based on the patient’s anticipated compliance as well as his/her family and social background.   4. Duration of anticoagulation For patients with unprovoked PE, oral anticoagulation is recommended for at least 3 months. In the extended treatment of VTE, NOACs are both effective (in terms of prevention of symptomatic or fatal VTE recurrence) and safe (particularly in terms of major bleeding), probably safer than standard VKA regimens. In patients who refuse to take or are unable to tolerate any form of oral anticoagulants, aspirin may be considered for extended secondary VTE prophylaxis.   5. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) Organized unresolved thrombi and pulmonary vascular remodelling contribute to progressive right ventricular failure and poor outcome in non-treated CTEPH. Life-long anticoagulation (with VKA and an INR of 2-3) is recommended for all patients with CTEPH. Pulmonary endarterectomy is the treatment of choice for the majority of patients. Pharmacotherapy and pulmonary angioplasty are emerging as treatment alternatives for non-operable patients as well as for those with pulmonary hypertension persisting after intervention.   6. PE in pregnancy Suspicion of PE in pregnancy warrants formal diagnostic assessment with validated methods. A negative D-dimer result has similar clinical significance as in non-pregnant patients. Perfusion lung scan may be considered to rule out suspected PE in pregnant women with a normal chest X-ray. A weight-adjusted dose of LMWH is the recommended therapy during pregnancy in patients without shock or hypotension. NOACs are contraindicated in pregnancy.   7. PE and cancer The risk of VTE in cancer patients is at least four times higher than in the general population and increases further with chemotherapy and surgical treatment. Incidental finding of pulmonary artery thrombi in cancer patients should be managed in the same way as symptomatic pulmonary embolism, particularly if found in segmental or more proximal arteries. For patients with PE and cancer, weight-adjusted subcutaneous LMWH should be considered for the first 3 to 6 months. Extended anticoagulation (beyond the first 3 to 6 months) should be considered for an indefinite period or until the cancer is considered cured.",

    "text": "The diagnostic value and clinical significance of subsegmental defects on CT angiography are still debated. Patients with incidental (unsuspected PE) on CT angiography should probably be treated, especially if they have cancer and a proximal clot, but solid evidence in support of this recommendation is lacking. The benefits versus risks of “triple rule-out” CT angiography (to confirm or exclude coronary artery disease, pulmonary embolism and/or aortic dissection) need thorough evaluation - also considering increased radiation and contrast exposure - given the low prevalence of PE and aortic dissection in published series using that approach. Preliminary results suggest that reduced-dose intravenous thrombolysis may be safe and effective, particularly in intermediate-risk PE, but solid evidence is still lacking. Catheter-directed treatment (e.g. pharmacomechanical thrombolysis) has shown a promising efficacy and (particularly) safety profile, but data from larger study populations are needed to determine whether it will become a widely accepted (and widely available) alternative option to systemic thrombolysis for reperfusion treatment. The results of the phase III trials on the use of new oral anticoagulants in the treatment of PE and secondary prevention of VTE appear convincing; clinical experience with these drugs under ‘real world’ conditions is accumulating. Further management trials are necessary to crystallize the criteria that might permit early discharge and home treatment of low-risk patients with acute PE. The true risk for developing CTEPH after acute PE needs to be determined on the basis of high-quality data. There is lack of data to support the use of riociguat, or the off-label use of drugs approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension, as a therapeutic bridge to pulmonary endarterectomy in CTEPH patients considered to be at high risk due to poor haemodynamics. Advances in balloon pulmonary angioplasty are continuing in an attempt to make this technique a therapeutic alternative for selected patients with non-operable CTEPH. Data on the validity of clinical prediction rules for PE in pregnancy are lacking. The evidence supporting screening for occult cancer after unprovoked VTE is inconclusive. Further data are needed on the treatment of cancer patients with NOACs.",

    "text": "1. The holistic view to the aorta as “whole organ” The guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of aortic diseases highlight the value of a holistic approach, viewing the aorta as the whole organ; indeed, in many cases tandem lesions of the aorta may exist, as illustrated by the increased probability of thoracic aortic aneurysm in the case of abdominal aortic aneurysm, making a distinction between the two regions inadequate. In addition thorako-abdominal aortic diseases are overwriting this separation.   2. Diagnostic Imaging Whereas a clinical examination and laboratory testing play a minor role in the diagnosis and treatment of aortic diseases, imaging techniques, particularly modern images techniques, play a major role yielding a view of the total aorta, which requires standardized reports and measurements at given landmarks.   Comparison of methods for imaging the aorta   Advantages/​disadvantages TTE TOE CTc MRIc Aortography Ease of use +++ ++ +++ ++ + Diagnostic reliability + +++ +++ +++ ++ Bedside/​interventional usea ++ ++ – – ++ Serial examinations ++ + ++(+)b +++ – Aortic wall visualizationc + +++ +++ +++ – Cost – – – – – – – – – – Radiation 0 0 – – – – – – Nephrotoxicity 0 0 – – – – – – – –   CT = computed tomography; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; TOE = transoesophageal echocardiography; TTE = transthoracic echocardiography. + means a positive aspect and – means a negative point.

It is recommended to measure diameters at anatomical landmarks perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. In case of repetitive imaging of the aorta the imaging should be used, with the lowest iatrogenic risk. In addition, it is recommended to use the same imaging modality with the similar method of measurement. All relevant parameters are recommended to be reported recording to the aortic segmentation. It is recommended to assess renal function, pregnancy and history of allergy to contrast agents in order to select the optimal imaging modality with minimal radiation exposure. Complete list of normal values for all discussed imaging techniques are found in the Full Text and Web Addenda.   3. The acute aortic syndrome Acute aortic syndromes (AAS) are defined as emergency conditions with similar clinical characteristics involving the aorta: aortic dissection, intramural haematoma, penetrating aortic ulcer, complete rupture of the aorta, traumatic aortic injury, iatrogenic aortic dissection. A flowchart for the emergency room has been developed in order to enhance the standardization of decision making in acute aortic syndromes, because survival is strongly related to time. In the diagnostic work-up clinical data are useful to assess the priori probability of AAS including the high-risk patient conditions, high-risk pain features and signs of high-risk examination features.     High-risk conditions Marfan syndrome (or other connective tissue diseases) Family history of aortic disease Known aortic valve disease Known thoracic aortic aneurysm Previous aortic manipulation (including cardiac surgery) High-risk pain features Chest, back, or abdominal pain described as any of the following: abrupt onset severe intensity ripping or tearing High-risk examination features Evidence of perfusion deficit: pulse deficit systolic blood pressure difference focal neurological deficit (in conjunction with pain) Aortic diastolic murmur (new and with pain) Hypotension or shock Risk score varies from 0–3 according the number of positive categories (1 point per column). Table modified from Rogers AM et al Circulation 2011;123:2213-8.   Based on the probability of acute aortic syndromes the decision making can be based according to developed flow-chart.   Flowchart for decision-making based on pretest sensitivity of AAS AAS = acute aortic syndrome; AD = aortic dissection; ESC = European Society of Cardiology; CT = computed tomography; ECG = electrocardiogram; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; STEMI = ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; TTE = transthoracic echocardiography; TOE = transoesophageal echocardiography. aSTEMI can be associated with AAS in rare cases. - bPending local availability, patient characteristics, and physician experience. cProof of Type A AD by the presence of flap, aortic regurgitation, and/or pericardial effusion. - dPreferably point-of-care, otherwise classical. eAlso troponin to detect non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.   4. Treatment of acute aortic syndrome 4.1 Medical management A lot of patients with aortic diseases have comorbidities such as coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and others. Therefore treatment and prevention strategies have to be similar to those indicated for the above diseases. Specific treatments in different aortic diseases are addressed in each specific chapter.   4.2 (Thoracic) endovascular aortic repair ((T)EVAR) It is recommended to decide the indication of endovascular repair on individual basis according to anatomy, pathology, comorbidity and anticipated durability, of any repair using multidisciplinary approach (Class I C). A sufficient proximal and distal landing zone of at least 2 cm is recommended for the safe deployment and durable fixation of TEVAR (Class I C). In case of aortic aneurysm it is recommended to select a stent-graft with a diameter exceeding the diameter of the landing zones by at least 10-15% of the reference aorta (Class I C). During stent graft placement, invasive blood pressure monitoring and control either pharmacologically or by rapid pacing is recommended (Class I C). For complicated type B aortic dissection, TEVAR is recommended (Class I C). If the anatomy is suitable and the expertise available endovascular repair should be preferred over open surgery in contained rupture of thoracic aortic aneurysm (Class I C). For uncomplicated type B aortic dissection endovascular therapy should be considered (Class IIa B) as well as in complicated type B intramural haematoma, complicated type B penetrating aortic ulcer and traumatic aortic injury (Class IIa C)   4.3 Surgery in acute aortic syndrome In patient with type A aortic dissection urgent surgery is recommended (Class I B). Surgery is also indicated in typ A intramural haematoma (Class I C). In case of type B penetrating aortic ulcer, surgery should be considered (Class IIa C). For complicated type B aortic dissection, intramural haematoma and penetrating aortic ulcer surgery may be considered (Class IIb C).   5. Aortic aneuryms When an aortic aneurysm is identified at any location, assessment of the entire aorta and aortic valve is recommended at baseline and during follow-up (Class I C). In case of aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, duplex ultrasound for screening of peripheral artery disease and peripheral aneurysms should be considered (Class IIa C). Patients with aortic aneurysms are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, general principles of cardiovascular prevention should be considered (Class IIa C).   5.1 Indication for intervention for ascending and arch aortic aneuryms Surgery is indicated in patients who have aortic root aneurysms with maximal aortic diameter ≥50 mm for patients with Marfan syndrome (Class I C). Surgery should be considered in patients who have aortic root aneurysm with maximal ascending aortic diameter: ≥45 mm for patients with Marfan syndromes with risk factors (family history of aortic dissection and/or aortic diameter increase >3 mm/year ≥50 mm for patients with bicuspid valve with risk factors ≥55 mm for patients with no elastopathy (Class IIa C). Surgery should be considered in patients who have isolated aortic arch aneurysm with maximal diameter ≥55 mm (Class IIa C). Lower levels thresholds for intervention may be considered according to body surface area in patients of small stature or in case of rapid progression, aortic valve regurgitation, planned pregnancy, and patients preference (Class IIb C). Aortic arch repair may be considered in patient with aortic arch aneurysm who already have an indication for surgery of an adjacent aneurysm located in the ascending aorta or descending aorta (Class IIb C).   5.2 Intervention for descending aortic aneurysms Valvular problems associated with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) are covered in the 2012 ESC/EACTS guidelines on management of valvular diseases (European Heart J 2012;33:2451-2496).   6. Abdominal aortic aneurysm Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) have a prevalence of about 2% and are particularly found in men >65 years and women who are smoking >65 years. Aortic AAA are usually asymptomatic until rupture occurs. The aortic diameter relates to risks of rupture. As a screening tool ultrasound is recommended in all men >65 years (Class I A) and considered in women >65 years and tobacco smoking (Class IIb C). Very new is the advice, to use a 2 minutes extra time during TTE to check for existence of an asymptomatic AAA in men >65 years (Class IIa B) and women >65 years who are smoking (Class IIb C). Target screening should be considered in first degree siblings of AAA patients (Class IIa B). Please check 2014 ESC/ESA Guidelines on non-cardiac surgery for cardiovascular risk assessment and management (European Heart J 2014:35:2383-2431). Additional information concerning reduction of cardiac risk in case of intervention and surgery are given.   6.1 Endovascular aortic repair and open vascular surgery About 60% of all AAA are suitable for endovascular therapy. In randomized controlled studies endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) reduced mortality threshold. But long-term result were similar due to high re-intervention rates. Smoking cessation is recommended to slow the AAA growth (Class I B). AAA repair is indicated if AAA diameter exceeds 55 mm (Class I B). If the anatomy is suitable for EVAR, either open or endovascular aortic repair is recommended (Class I A). If the aneurysm is anatomically not suitable for EVAR, open endovascular aortic surgery is recommended (Class I C). 6.2 Management of symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms In case of rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms two randomized controlled trials are available demonstrating similar 30 days mortality results (30.4% versus 37.4%). Based on these results following recommendations are given. In suspected ruptured AAA, immediate abdominal ultrasound is recommended (Class I C). In case of rupture, AAA emergency repair is indicated (Class I C). In case of symptomatic but non rupture AAA, urgent repair is indicated (Class I C). In case of symptomatic AAA anatomical suitable for EVAR, either open or endovascular repair is recommended (Class I A).   7. Long-term follow-up for chronic aortic dissection Contrast CT or MRI is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of chronic aortic dissection (Class I C). Close imaging surveillance in aortic dissection is indicated to detect signs of complications (Class I C). In patients with chronic aortic dissection, tight blood pressure control (> 130/80 mmHg) is indicated (Class I C). After TEVAR or EVAR surveillance is recommended after 1 month, 6 months, 12 months and then yearly (Class I C). CT is recommended as the first choice imaging technique for follow-up after TEVAR or EVAR (Class I C). In AAA Doppler ultrasound with or without contrast agents should be considered for annual postoperative surveillance, with non-contrast CT imaging over 5 years (Class IIa C). For follow-up in young patients MRI should be preferred to CT for imaging magnetic resonance-compatible stent grafts (Class IIa C).   8. Genetic diseases affording the aorta Chromosomal and inherited syndromic thoracic aneurysms During the last years more insight into chromosomal aortic diseases have been given not only for the Marfan syndrome, but also for the Loeys-Dietz syndrome, the Turner syndrome, the Ehlers Danlos syndrome Typ IV, non syndromic familiar aortic aneurysms and even aneurysms – osteoarthritis syndrome and arterial tortuosity syndrome. It is recommended to investigate first degree relatives (siblings and parents) of a subject with thoracic aortic disease to indentify a familiar form in which relatives all have a 50% chance of carrying the familiar mutation-disease (Class I C). Once a familial form of thoracic acute aortic dissection (TAAD) is highly suspected, it is recommended to refer the patient to geneticist for family investigation and molecular testing (Class I C). Variable of age of oncet warrants screening every 5 years of “healthy” at-risk relatives until diagnosis (clinical or molecular) is established or ruled out (Class I C). In familial non syndromic TAAD, screening for aneurysm should be considered not only in the thoracic aorta, but also throughout the arterial tree (including cerebral arteries) (Class IIa C).   8.1 Medical therapy in genetic diseases • In Marfan syndrome beta-blockers are prescribed to reduce the progression rate. • Angiotensin 2 receptor blockers demonstrated attenuation of the dilatation rate of aortic aneurysms. • In Ehlers-Danlos syndrome beta-blockers reduce arterial complications. • No specific data are available for other genetic diseases.   9. Management of bicuspid aortic valve BAV have a prevalence of about 1%. Fusion of the right and left coronary cusp or fusion of the right and none coronary cusp or found combined with normal size aorta, supra-coronary dilatation or cylindric aortic shape. The maximal aortic dilatation rate does not differ for bicuspid aortic valve and Marfan syndrome and is maximal in the tubular aorta (0.42 ± 0.6 and 0.49 ± 0.5 mm/year). BAV have a high heritability with about one quarter with bicuspid aortic valve found in the first degree relatives. The aortic root dilatation is found in about one third in first degree relatives. In case of BAV, surgery is indicated when the aortic root or thoracic aorta diameter is >55 mm, >50 mm in presence of other risk factors, >45 mm when surgical aortic valve replacement is scheduled (Class I C). Because of the familial occurence screening of first degree relatives should be considered (Class IIa C).   10. Future developments The installation of hybrid rooms have been shown to be pacemakers for the development of new diagnostic and treatment options like thoracic endovascular aortic repair, debranching or aortic arch surgery, and the frozen elephant trunk. This can lead in the future to further paradigma changes in the diagnosis and treatment of aortic diseases. It is time to form aortic teams and centers in order to provide full access to experts in the field of cardiology, radiology, pediatric cardiology, genetics, aortic and cardiovascular surgery, which is needed not only for the acute but also for the intense follow-up of patients with aortic diseases.",

    "text": "The 2014 ESC Guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of aortic diseases contains in 118 recommendations 4% Class I A recommendations, and in 15% Class I-II B recommendations. Thus, 80% are consensus decision. We need more epidemiological data on acute aortic syndrome in Europe. More evidence needed on the caseload-outcome relationship in the field aortic diseases. The implantation and efficacy of aortic centers in Europe should be assessed. The establishment of a European network of aortic centers should be encouraged along with establishment of large registries and multicenter studies. The value of biomarkers should be clarified. More data of accuracy and reproducibility of aortic measurements are needed. The knowledge on relationship between aortic size and outcome should be improved and the superiority of 3D on 2D better documented. It has to been investigated, if there are difference of aortic diameters related to age, gender and body-size taken into account outcome of interventions. Data for female patients with aortic diseases are lacking. The lack of evidence on the efficacy of medical therapy and the role of antihypertensive drugs, statins, inflammatory drugs an non-syndromic aortic diseases like aortic dissection, thoracic aortic aneurysms and AAA, genetic diseases is present. For thoracic aortic aneurysms, randomized studies are needed and the optimal timing for preventive intervention according to lesion size and other characteristics as well as individual patient features. The optimal timing and techniques of intervention in chronic aortic dissection is still unclear.",

    "text": "1. Definition Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is defined by the presence of increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness that is not solely explained by abnormal loading conditions. In an adult, this represents a wall thickness ≥15 mm in one or more LV myocardial segments (or ≥13 mm in a first degree relative of someone with HCM) measured by any imaging technique.   2. Prevalence & Aetiology Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) occurs in 0.02–0.23%of adults, with much lower rates in patients diagnosed under the age of 25 years. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be caused by many genetic and non-genetic disorders. In up to 60% of patients with HCM, the disease is an autosomal dominant trait caused by mutations in cardiac sarcomere protein genes. 5-10% of adult cases are caused by other genetic disorders including inherited metabolic and neuromuscular diseases, chromosome abnormalities and genetic syndromes.   3. Genetic Counselling & Testing Genetic counselling is recommended in all patients with unequivocal HCM when it cannot be explained solely by a non-genetic cause. When a definite causative genetic mutation is identified in a patient, his or her first degree relatives should first be genetically tested. They should undergo clinical evaluation if they are found to carry the same mutation.   4. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction Two-thirds of patients with HCM have dynamic obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOTO) at rest or during exercise caused by contact between the mitral valve and the interventricular septum during systole. In patients with a resting LVOT gradient <50 mmHg bedside physiological provocation with Valsalva manoeuvre and standing should be routinely performed during echocardiography to determine if LV outflow obstruction can be provoked. Exercise stress echocardiography is recommended in symptomatic patients with an LVOT gradient <50 mmHg at rest or during physiological provocation. When a gradient is detected in the LV cavity, the presence of sub-aortic membranes, structural mitral valve leaflet abnormalities and mid-cavity obstruction should be systematically excluded.   5. Assessment of symptoms Most people with HCM are asymptomatic and have a normal life expectancy but somedevelop symptoms, often many years after the first manifestation of ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities. Systematic 2-D and Doppler echcardiography, exercise testing and ambulatory ECG monitoring are usually sufficient to determine the most likely cause of symptoms.   6. Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death While the risk of sudden death is low for most patients with HCM, a small number are prone to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. The use of a new risk calculator (HCMRisk-SCD) (http://doc2do.com/hcm/webHCM.html) is recommended to guide the use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD). In all patients, clinical efficacy of ICD implantation should be balanced against its potential risk.   7. Symptomatic treatment In symptomatic patients with LVOTO, the aim is to reduce dyspnoea and chest pain by using drugs, surgical myectomy, alcohol ablation or pacing. Therapy in symptomatic patients without LVOTO focuses on management of arrhythmias, reduction of LV filling pressures, and treatment of angina. Patients with symptomatic progressive LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction refractory to medical therapy may be candidates for cardiac transplantation.   8. Atrial Arrhythmias Patients with HCM and paroxysmal, persistent or permanent AF should receive treatment with vitamin K antagonists. Lifelong therapy with oral anticoagulants is recommended, even when sinus rhythm is restored. Patients in sinus rhythm with LA diameter ≥45 mm should undergo 6–12 monthly 48-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring to detect AF.   9. Management of Pregnancy Most women with HCM tolerate pregnancy well but require expert advice and monitoring throughout pregnancy. All women with HCM should receive advice on contraception, sterilisation and termination when appropriate.   10. Multidisciplinary Care Clinicians should consider referral of patients to multidisciplinary teams with expertise in the diagnosis, genetics, risk stratification and management of myocardial disease.",

    "text": "The document outlines an innovative classification of bradyarrhythmias by mechanism. There are three main groups: persistent bradycardia, intermittent bradycardia with electrocardiographic documentation, and suspected intermittent bradycardia (not yet documented). Recommendations are provided for the three categories. Until now, guidelines and text books have classified bradyarrhythmias according to their aetiology, for example sinus node dysfunction, myocardial infarction, or bundle branch block. Classification of bradyarrhythmias according to mechanism (i.e., the clinical presentation) is more useful for selecting patients for permanent cardiac pacing therapy than their aetiology. The strength of indications for CRT focuses mainly on the presence or absence of left bundle branch block. Unique recommendations are given for NYHA class II and III patients. A spectrum of response to CRT, as with most other treatments, is recognized: the beneficial effects of CRT may be greater in females, patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy and patients with QRS duration >150 ms (the longer the QRS duration, the greater the benefit). Different recommendations are given for an upgrade or “de novo“ implantation of CRT in patients with a brady indication for pacing. Clinical guidance to the choice between CRT-P or CRT-D in primary prevention is provided. In the decision process for indication for pacing/CRT and for the choice of the best modality attention should be paid to a careful evaluation of the risk of complications. In general the risk of complications is higher when implanting more complex devices and for re-intervention and upgrades.",

    "text": "1 - Diabetes mellitus is A metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion or action, or a combination of both. ≈ 95% comprised by T2DM. An important contributor to vascular damage inducing a high risk of macro-and microvascular complications.   2 - Identification Screening for T2DM can be implemented using a non-invasive risk score (e.g. FINDRISC) supplemented by the assessment of glycaemia in people at high risk. Diagnosis of DM can be made by the measurement of FPG (>7.0 mmol/L), 2hPG (>11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c (>6.5%). HbA1c <6.5% does not exclude a diagnosis of diabetes which should be further investigated by OGTT in people at high risk of disturbed glucose metabolism. Abnormal PG or HbA1c test results should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis.   3 - Prevention Progression of IGT to DM can be delayed by lifestyle intervention in about 50% of individuals. The intervention effect is sustained after lifestyle counselling has ceased. Pharmacotherapies (a-glucosidase inhibitors, metformin, glitazones, insulin, ARBs) can delay progression to DM in people with IGT whilst the drug is taken.   4 - Assessment of individual cardiovascular risk Classical risk factors (family history, lifestyle, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia). Glycaemic status. Macrovascular disease (coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral artery disease, heart failure). Microvascular disease (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy). Arrhythmias especially atrial fibrillation.   5 - Multifactorial management of cardiovascular risk Patient education and empowerment. Life style advice. Smoking cessation. Personalised treatment of blood pressure, lipids, glucose and thrombotic risk.   6 - Life style intervention Daily consumption of vegetable and fruits. Increased dietary fibre intake. Moderate intake of simple carbohydrates. Reduced total dietary fat intake. Replacement of saturated fat by monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fat. Physical activity >30 min/day or at least 150 min/week. Weight reduction >5% if BMI >25 kg/m2. Moderate alcohol consumption.   7 - Key targets* for prevention of cardiovascular disease BP <140/85 mmHg. LDL cholesterol <1.8 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL). HbA1c <7% (<53 mmol/mol). *These targets should be applied with individual needs taken into account.   8 - Multifactorial medical management A combination of blood pressure lowering agents is often required to achieve control and RAAS blockade should be part of the treatment. Lipid control is based on statins. Antiplatelet therapy is recommended for secondary prevention of CVD. A combination of glucose lowering agents is often required to achieve glycaemic control and metformin should be considered as first line treatment especially in overweight/obese patients.   9 - Options for revascularisation Acute coronary syndromes Early angiography and culprit lesion revascularization should be offered. Stable coronary artery disease CABG is preferred if the myocardial area at risk is large (multi-vessel disease, complex coronary lesions). PCI with DES may be performed for symptom control in single- and two-vessel disease. Peripheral artery disease Critical limb ischaemia and symptomatic carotid artery disease should be revascularised.   10 - Heart failure T2DM is a major risk factor for the development of heart failure. The combination of DM and heart failure has a 12-fold higher mortality than DM alone. Pharmacological management include combinations of RAAS inhibitors, beta blockade and diuretic therapy. Non-pharmacological approaches should be considered as in patients without DM .   11 - Multidisciplinary strategies Comprehensive care of DM patients often requires collaboration between specialists in cardiology, diabetology and primary care and several other subspecialties such as surgery ophthalmology, nephrology and psychiatry. Nurses, dieticians, podiatrists and physiotherapists and care professionals are important collaborators.",

The myocardial injury is considered acute if there is a rise and/‍or fall of cTn values. Criteria for acute myocardial infarction (types 1, 2 and 3 MI) The term acute myocardial infarction should be used when there is acute myocardial injury with clinical evidence of acute myocardial ischaemia and with detection of a rise and/‍or fall of cTn values with at least one value above the 99th percentile URL and at least one of the following: Symptoms of myocardial ischaemia; New ischaemic ECG changes; Development of pathological Q waves; Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischaemic aetiology; Identification of a coronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy (not for types 2 or 3 MIs). Post-‍mortem demonstration of acute athero-‍thrombosis in the artery supplying the infarcted myocardium meets criteria for type 1 MI. Evidence of an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand unrelated to acute athero-‍thrombosis meets criteria for type 2 MI. Cardiac death in patients with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischaemia and presumed new ischaemic ECG changes before cTn values become available or abnormal meets criteria for type 3 MI. Criteria for coronary procedure-‍related myocardial infarction (types 4 and 5 MI) Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) related MI is termed type 4a MI. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) related MI is termed type 5 MI. Coronary procedure-‍related MI ≤48 hours after the index procedure is arbitrarily defined by an elevation of cTn values >5 times for type 4a MI and >10 times for type 5 MI of the 99th percentile URL in patients with normal baseline values. Patients with elevated pre-‍procedural cTn values, in whom the pre-‍procedural cTn level are stable (≤20% variation) or falling, must meet the criteria for a >5 or >10 fold increase and manifest a change from the baseline value of >20%. In addition with at least one of the following: New ischaemic ECG changes (this criterion is related to type 4a MI only); Development of new pathological Q waves; Imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium that is presumed to be new and in a pattern consistent with an ischaemic aetiology; Angiographic findings consistent with a procedural flow-‍limiting complication such as coronary dissection, occlusion of a major epicardial artery or graft, side-‍branch occlusion-‍thrombus, disruption of collateral flow or distal embolization. Isolated development of new pathological Q waves meets the type 4a MI or type 5 MI criteria with either revascularization procedure if cTn values are elevated and rising but less than the pre-‍specified thresholds for PCI and CABG. Other types of 4 MI include type 4b MI stent thrombosis and type 4c MI restenosis that both meet type 1 MI criteria. Post-‍mortem demonstration of a procedure-‍related thrombus meets the type 4a MI criteria or type 4b MI criteria if associated with a stent. Criteria for prior or silent/‍unrecognized myocardial infarction Any one of the following criteria meets the diagnosis for prior or silent/‍ unrecognized MI: Abnormal Q waves with or without symptoms in the absence of non-ischaemic causes.

    "text": "In the late 19th century, post-‍mortem examinations demonstrated a possible relationship between thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery and myocardial infarction (MI). However, it was not until the beginning of the 20th century that the first clinical descriptions appeared describing a connection between the formation of a thrombus in a coronary artery and its associated clinical features. Over the years, several different definitions of MI were used, leading to controversy and confusion. Hence, a general and worldwide definition for MI was needed. This occurred for the first time in the 1950–70s, when working groups from the World Health Organization (WHO) established a primarily electrocardiographic (ECG)-‍based definition of MI intended for epidemiological use. The original description, with minor modifications, is still used in epidemiological surveys. With the introduction of more sensitive cardiac biomarkers, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) collaborated to redefine MI using a biochemical and clinical approach, and reported that myocardial injury detected by abnormal biomarkers in the setting of acute myocardial ischaemia should be labelled as MI. This principle was further refined, leading to the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction Consensus Document in 2007, of which a novel MI classification system with five subcategories was introduced. This document, endorsed by the ESC, the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the World Heart Federation (WHF), was adopted by the WHO. However, the development of even more sensitive assays for markers of myocardial injury made a revision of the document necessary, which appeared as the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction Consensus Document in 2012.

    "text": "Studies have shown that myocardial injury, defined by an elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) value, is frequently encountered clinically and is associated with an adverse prognosis. Although myocardial injury is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of MI it is also an entity in itself. To establish a diagnosis of MI, criteria in addition to abnormal biomarkers are required. Non-‍ischaemic myocardial injury may arise secondary to many cardiac conditions such as myocarditis, or may be associated with non-‍cardiac conditions such as renal failure. Therefore, for patients with increased cTn values, clinicians must distinguish whether patients have suffered a non-‍ischaemic myocardial injury or one of the MI subtypes. If there is no evidence to support the presence of myocardial ischaemia, a diagnosis of myocardial injury should be made. The current Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction Consensus Document reflects these considerations hrough adhering to the clinical approach of the definition of myocardial infarction. Clinical criteria for myocardial infarction Clinical definition of MI denotes presence of acute myocardial injury detected by abnormal cardiac biomarkers in the setting of evidence of acute myocardial ischaemia.",

    "text": "Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and T (cTnT) are components of the contractile apparatus of myocardial cells and are expressed almost exclusively in the heart. Cardiac TnI and cTnT are the preferred biomarkers for the evaluation of myocardial injury. High-‍sensitivity cTn assays are recommended for routine clinical use. Other biomarkers e.g. creatine kinase MB isoform (CK-MB) are less sensitive and less specific. Myocardial injury is defined to be present when blood levels of cTn are increased above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL). The injury may be acute, as evidenced by a newly detected dynamic rising and/‍or falling pattern of cTn values above the 99th percentile URL, or chronic, in the setting of persistently elevated cTn levels. Criteria for myocardial injury Detection of an elevated cTn value above the 99th percentile URL is defined as myocardial injury. The injury is considered acute if there is a rise and/‍or fall of cTn values. Although elevated cTn values reflect injury to myocardial cells, they do not indicate the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and can arise following preloadinduced mechanical stretch or physiological stresses in otherwise normal hearts. Various causes have been suggested for the release of structural proteins from the myocardium, including normal turnover of myocardial cells, apoptosis, cellular release of cTn degradation products, increased cellular wall permeability, formation and release of membranous blebs, and myocyte necrosis. Yet, it is not possible clinically to distinguish which increases of cTn levels are due to which mechanisms. However, regardless of the mechanism, acute myocardial injury when associated with a rising and/‍or falling pattern of cTn values with at least one value above the 99th percentile URL and caused by myocardial ischaemia is designated as an acute MI. (Figure 2) Figure 2 Spectrum of myocardial injury, ranging from no injury to myocardial infarction cTn = cardiac troponin; URL = upper reference limit. aNo myocardial injury = cTn values ≤99th percentile URL or not detectable. bMyocardial injury = cTn values >99th percentile URL. cMyocardial infarction = clinical evidence of myocardial ischaemia and a rise and/‍or fall of cTn values >99th percentile URL. Various clinical entities may involve these myocardial categories for example, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, heart failure, kidney disease, hypotension/‍shock, hypoxaemia and anaemia. Myocardial ischaemic or non-‍ischaemic conditions associated with increased cTn values are presented in Table 1. The complexity of clinical circumstances may sometimes make it difficult to discriminate specific individual mechanism(s) of myocardial injury. In this situation, the multifactorial contributions resulting in myocardial injury should be described in the patient record.

It is usual practice to designate MI in patients with chest discomfort or other ischaemic symptoms, who develop new ST-‍segment elevations in two contiguous leads, or new bundle branch blocks with ischaemic repolarization patterns as an ST-‍elevation MI (STEMI) (see ECG section). In contrast, patients without ST-‍segment elevation at presentation are usually designated non-ST-‍elevation MI (NSTEMI).

    "text": "The pathophysiological mechanism leading to ischaemic myocardial injury in the context of a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand has been classified as type 2 MI. In patients with stable known or presumed CAD, an acute stressor such as an acute gastrointestinal bleed with a precipitous drop in haemoglobin, or a sustained tachyarrhythmia with clinical manifestations of myocardial ischaemia, may result in myocardial injury and a type 2 MI. These effects are due to insufficient blood flow to the ischaemic myocardium to meet the increased myocardial oxygen demand of the stressor. Ischaemic thresholds may vary substantially in individual patients depending on the magnitude of the stressor, the presence of non-‍cardiac comorbidities and the extent of underlying CAD and cardiac structural abnormalities. Coronary atherosclerosis is a common finding in type 2 MI patients selected for coronary angiography. In some cases, coronary embolism caused by thrombi, calcium or vegetation from the atria or ventricles or acute aortic dissection may result in a type 2 MI. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection with or without intramural haematoma is another non-‍atherosclerotic condition that may occur, especially in young women. It is defined as spontaneous dissection of the coronary artery wall with accumulation of blood within the false lumen, which can compress the true lumen to varying degrees (Figure 4).

A diagnosis of MI, however, still requires, in addition to an increase of cTn values, evidence of myocardial ischaemia that may be evident from the peri- and postoperative period e.g. ST-‍segment changes on telemetry/‍ECG, repeated episodes of hypoxia, hypotension, tachycardia, etc. or imaging evidence of MI. In the absence of evidence for acute myocardial ischaemia, a diagnosis of acute myocardial injury is more appropriate.",

Direct cellular toxicity related to inflammation, circulating neurohormones and infiltrative processes may present with HF and abnormal cTn measurements indicating myocardial injury.

The onset of TTS is often triggered by intense emotional or physical stresses and over 90% of patients are post-‍menopausal women. ST-‍segment elevation is frequent but the extent of the ST-‍segment elevation is usually widespread across the lateral and precordial leads, beyond that of a single coronary artery distribution. There are usually transient elevations in cTn levels, but the peak cTn values observed are modest and in contrast with the large territory of ECG changes or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. The rise and fall in cTn levels support an acute myocardial injury, secondary to the high catecholamine surges which are known to trigger cTn release from cardiomyocytes. Coronary vasospasm or high myocardial strain hypercontractility or high ventricular afterload may also contribute to myocardial ischaemia. The diagnosis of TTS should be suspected when the clinical manifestations and ECG abnormalities are out of proportion to the degree of elevation of cTn values and when the distribution of the LV wall motion abnormalities does not correlate with a single coronary artery distribution. However, coronary angiography and ventriculography are often needed to secure the diagnosis.",

The diagnosis of MINOCA, like the diagnosis of MI, indicates that there is an ischaemic mechanism responsible for the myocyte injury. The prevalence of MINOCA is estimated to be 6–8% among patients diagnosed with MI and more common in women than men as well as in patients presenting with NSTEMI than STEMI. Atherosclerotic plaque disruption and coronary thrombosis may be a cause of MINOCA, i.e. type 1 MI. However, coronary spasm and spontaneous coronary dissection may be involved as well, i.e. type 2 MI, along with other possible causes. Additional coronary imaging and functional testing methods may be useful to elucidate the mechanisms of ischaemia in MINOCA.",

It has been shown using hs-‍cTn assays that renal dysfunction is commonly associated with cardiovascular abnormalities. The mechanisms include increased ventricular pressure, small-‍vessel coronary obstruction, anaemia, hypotension, and possibly direct toxic effects on the myocardium associated with the uraemic state. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis and autophagy due to acute wall stretch have been demonstrated experimentally. Studies suggest that serial changes in cTn levels are equally effective in diagnosing MI in patients with CKD and in those with normal renal function. If the level of elevated cTn values is unchanging, the elevated level is likely a reflection of chronic myocardial injury. However, if a rising and/‍or falling pattern is present and it is accompanied by ischaemic symptoms, new ischaemic ECG changes, or loss of viable myocardium on imaging, a diagnosis of acute MI is likely.",

An idealized view of troponin kinetics in patients with acute MI is shown in Figure 7. It should be appreciated that because biomarker release is substantially dependent on blood flow, there is significant variability in the time to peak value (velocity), the time when a normal value may become greater than the 99th percentile URL or when a changing pattern of values can be observed. The ability to define a changing pattern will also depend on timing. For example,around peak values, it may be difficult to observe a changing pattern of values. Similarly, the downslope of the time-‍concentration curve is much slower than the upslope. These issues need to be taken into account when defining whether or not a changing pattern is present. Figure 7 Illustration of early cardiac troponin kinetics in patients after acute myocardial injury including acute myocardial infarction cTn = cardiac troponin; URL = upper reference limit. The timing of biomarker release into the circulation is dependent on blood flow and how soon after the onset of symptoms samples are obtained. Thus, the ability to consider small changes as diagnostic can be problematic. In addition, many comorbidities increase cTn values, and in particular hs-‍cTn values, so that elevations can be present at baseline even in those with myocardial infarction who present early after the onset of symptoms. Changes in cTn values or deltas can be used to define acute compared to chronic events and the ability to detect these is indicated in the figure.

It is recommended that values for cTn assays be reported as whole numbers in nanograms per litre (ng/L) to avoid interpretation problems associated with multiple zeroes and decimal points that can often result in confusion.

The sampling interval will impact the clinical cut-‍off at baseline and what is determined to be a pathological rise and/‍or fall of the biomarker. Sampling beyond 6 h may be required if further ischaemic episodes occur, or in high-‍risk patients. To establish the diagnosis of an acute MI, a rise and/‍or fall in cTn values with at least one value above the 99th percentile URL is required, coupled with a high clinical and/‍or ECG likelihood of myocardial ischaemia. Strategies employing either very low levels of hs-‍cTn on presentation or the lack of any change and persistently normal hs-‍cTn values over a 1–2 h period after presentation have been advocated to exclude acute myocardial injury and MI as well. A single sample rule out strategy using a very low value has high sensitivity for myocardial injury and therefore high negative predictive value to exclude MI. The clinical specificity and positive predictive value of such 1–2 h sampling approaches for ruling in MI are limited by the substantial proportion of individuals who meet the proposed biomarker criteria with diagnoses other than MI.

Acute myocardial ischaemia is often associated with dynamic changes in ECG waveform and serial ECG acquisition can provide critical information, particularly if the ECG at initial presentation is non-‍diagnostic. Recording several standard ECGs with fixed electrode positions at 15–30 min intervals for the initial 1–2 h, or the use of ontinuous computer-‍assisted 12-lead ECG recording, if available, to detect dynamic ECG changes, is reasonable for patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms or an initial non-‍diagnostic ECG. The J-‍point (junction between QRS termination and ST-‍segment onset) is used to determine the magnitude of the ST-‍segment shift with the onset of the QRS serving as the reference point. In patients with a stable baseline, the TP segment (isoelectric interval) is a more accurate method to assess the magnitude of ST-‍segment shift, and in distinguishing pericarditis from acute myocardial ischaemia. Tachycardia and baseline shift are common in the acute setting and can make this determination difficult. Therefore, QRS onset is recommended as the reference point for J-‍point determination. (Figure 8) Figure 8 ECG example of ST-‍segment elevation The initial onset of the Q wave shown by arrow 1 serves as the reference point and arrow 2 shows the onset of the ST-‍segment or J-‍point.

    "text": "ESC Task Force has selected 19 simple rules to guide the diagnosis and management of syncope patients with TLOC according to the 2018 ESC guidelines on syncope:   Diagnosis: initial evaluation At the initial evaluation answer the following 4 key questions: Was the event TLOC? In case of TLOC, is it of syncopal or non-syncopal origin? In case of suspected syncope, is there a clear aetiological diagnosis? Is there evidence to suggest a high risk of cardiovascular events or death? At the evaluation of TLOC in the ED answer the following 3 key questions: Is there a serious underlying cause that can be identified? If the cause is uncertain, what is the risk of a serious outcome? Should the patient be admitted to hospital? In all patients, perform a complete history taking, physical examination (including standing BP measurement) and standard ECG. Perform immediate ECG monitoring (in bed or telemetry) in high-‍risk patients when there is a suspicion of arrhythmic syncope. Perform an echocardiogram when there is previous known heart disease or data suggestive of structural heart disease or syncope secondary to cardiovascular cause. Perform CSM in patients >40 years of age with syncope of unknown origin compatible with a reflex mechanism. Perform tilt testing in case there is suspicion of syncope due to reflex or an orthostatic cause. Perform blood tests when clinically indicated, e.g. haematocrit and cell blood count when haemorrhage is suspected, oxygen saturation and blood gas analysis when hypoxic syndromes are suspected, troponin when cardiac-‍ischaemia related syncope is suspected, D-‍dimer when pulmonary embolism is suspected, etc. Diagnosis: subsequent investigations Perform prolonged ECG monitoring (external or implantable) in patients with recurrent severe unexplained syncope who: have clinical or ECG features suggesting arrhythmic syncope; and have a high probability of recurrence of syncope in a reasonable time; and may benefit a specific therapy if a cause for syncope is found. Perform EPS in patients with unexplained syncope and bifascicular BBB (impending high degree AV block) or suspected tachycardia. Perform an exercise stress test in patients who experience syncope during or shortly after exertion. Consider basic autonomic function tests (Valsalva manoeuvre and deep breathing test) and ABPM for assessment of autonomic function in patients with suspected neurogenic OH. Consider video recording (at home or in hospital) of TLOC suspected of non-syncopal nature. Treatment To all patients with reflex syncope and OH, explain the diagnosis, reassure, explain the risk of recurrence, and give advice on how to avoid triggers and situations. These measures are the cornerstone of treatment and have a high impact in reducing the recurrence of syncope. In patients with severe forms of reflex syncope, select one or more of the following additional specific treatments according to the clinical features: Midodrine or fludrocortisone in young patients with low BP phenotype; Counter-‍pressure manoeuvres (including tilt training if needed) in young patients with prodromes; ILR-‍guided management strategy in selected patients without or with short prodromes; Discontinuation/‍reduction of hypotensive therapy targeting a systolic BP of 140 mmHg in old hypertensive patients; Pacemaker implantation in old patients with dominant cardioinhibitory forms. In patients with OH, select one or more of the following additional specific treatments according to clinical severity: Education regarding lifestyle manoeuvres; Adequate hydration and salt intake; Discontinuation/‍reduction of hypotensive therapy; Counter-‍pressure manoeuvres; Abdominal binders and/‍or support stockings; Head-‍up tilt sleeping; Midodrine or fludrocortisone. Ensure that all patients with cardiac syncope receive the specific therapy of the culprit arrhythmia and/‍or of the underlying disease. Balance benefit and harm of an ICD implantation in patients with unexplained syncope at high risk of SCD (e.g. those affected by left ventricle systolic dysfunction, HCM, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, or inheritable arrhythmogenic disorders). In this situation, unexplained syncope is defined as syncope that does not meet any Class I diagnostic criterion defined in the tables of recommendations of the 2018 ESC guidelines on syncope and is considered a suspected arrhythmic syncope. Re-‍evaluate the diagnostic process and consider alternative therapies if the above rules fail or are not applicable to an individual patient. Bear in mind that guidelines are only advisory. Even though they are based on the best available scientific evidence, treatment should be tailored to an individual patient’s need.",

    "text": "2.0.0.0 Major gaps in evidence Clinicians responsible for managing patients with TLOC must frequently make treatment decisions without adequate evidence or a consensus of expert opinion. The following is a short list of selected, common issues that deserve to be addressed in future clinical research.   Diagnosis – gap between the best available scientific evidence and the need for dissemination of these concepts into clinical practice There is wide variation in practice of syncope evaluation, and wide variation in adoption of recommendations from published guidelines. The absence of a systematic approach to TLOC incurs higher health and social care costs, unnecessary hospitalizations and diagnostic procedures, prolongation of hospital stays, lower diagnostic rates, and higher rates of misdiagnoses and symptom recurrences. Therefore, there is a need for: Despite the recommendation from the ESC guidelines on syncope, syncope units are not widely established in clinical practice. Barriers to establishing a syncope unit include lack of resources, lack of trained dedicated staff, and complex presentations to multiple settings, necessitating involvement from multiple disciplines. The evidence for usefulness of syncope units is controversial. Therefore, there is a need for: Large clinical studies that assess the diagnostic yield and compliance of a guideline-‍based standardized systematic approach Large clinical studies that test the superiority of management in a dedicated syncope facility versus conventional management   Diagnosis – need for new diagnostic tests and devices BP recording is crucial for the majority of clinical TLOC situations and will add important information for treatment of syncope. Unfortunately, current long-‍term BP (or surrogate) recording systems are not optimal for diagnostic use in the syncope evaluation setting. Therefore, there is a need for: Development and validation of new diagnostic multiparametric devices that can record heart rhythm and BP (and possibly other physiological parameters such as cerebral saturation or EEG) at the time of a syncopal event.   Treatment – lack of evidence of efficacy of most available therapies Only a few small randomized controlled trials have been done on treatment of syncope. In addition, syncopal recurrences are unpredictable and often decrease spontaneously after medical assessment, even in the absence of a specific therapy. The consequence of the spontaneous decrease is that any therapy for syncope prevention appears to be more effective than it actually is and makes the results of observational data on therapy questionable in the absence of a control group. No therapy can be effective for all patients. Any therapy should be assessed in homogeneous subgroups. Therefore, there is strong urgent need of randomized controlled clinical trials on the efficacy of: Pharmacological therapies targeted to specific subgroups of reflex syncope. Pacemaker therapy targeted to specific subgroups of cardioinhibitory reflex syncope. Pharmacological therapies of OH-‍mediated syncope. ICD therapy targeted to specific subgroups of patients with unexplained syncope at risk of SCD.   Treatment – need for new therapies There is the need to move towards personalized medicine. Improving the knowledge of the biochemical mechanisms underlying specific forms of reflex syncope will allow the development of new therapies in such specific settings. For example, a low adenosine phenotype and a low norepinephrine phenotype have been recently identified. Therefore, there is a need for: Syncope is a transient phenomenon. The ideal therapy should be that is administered only when needed. Therefore, there is a need for: Randomized clinical trials on the efficacy of theophylline (and other xantine antagonists) for low adenosine syncope and norepinephrine transport inhibitors for low epinephrine syncope. Randomized clinical trials of on-‍demand administration of specific therapy based on specific sensors similar to adrenalin injectors in asthma or nasal spray for paroxysmal SVT.",

Syncope shares many clinical features with other disorders: it therefore presents in many differential diagnoses. This group of disorders is labelled TLOC. TLOC is defined as a state of real or apparent LOC with loss of awareness, characterized by amnesia for the period of unconsciousness, abnormal motor control, loss of responsiveness, and a short duration.

    "text": "4.2.0.0 Remarks There are two main pathophysiological mechanisms in reflex syncope. “Vasodepression” refers to conditions in which insufficient sympathetic vasoconstriction results in hypotension. “Cardioinhibition” is used when bradycardia or asystole predominates, reflecting a shift towards parasympathetic predominance. The haemodynamic pattern, i.e. cardioinhibitory, vasodepressive, or both, is independent of the trigger evoking reflex syncope. For example, micturition syncope and orthostatic VVS may equally well present as cardioinhibitory or as vasodepressor syncope. The non-‍classical form of reflex syncope involves a heterogeneous group of patients. The term is used to describe reflex syncope that occurs with uncertain or apparently absent triggers and/‍or atypical presentation. The diagnosis of reflex syncope is probable when other causes of syncope are excluded (absence of structural heart disease) and/‍or symptoms are reproduced in the tilt test. At present, this group also contains syncope associated with low adenosine plasma levels. The cardiovascular causes of orthostatic intolerance include classical OH, initial OH, delayed OH, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and VVS, which in this context can be called orthostatic VVS.",

Figure 3 Flow diagram for initial evaluation and risk stratification of patients with syncope BP = blood pressure; ECG = electrocardiogram; H&P exam = history and physical examination; TLOC = transient loss of consciousness. For interactivity see here The initial syncope evaluation consists of: Careful history taking concerning present and previous attacks, as well as eyewitness accounts, in person or through a telephone interview; Physical examination, including supine and standing BP measurements; and Electrocardiogram (ECG).   Based on these findings, additional examinations may be performed when needed: Immediate ECG monitoring when there is a suspicion of arrhythmic syncope; Echocardiogram when there is previous known heart disease or data suggestive of structural heart disease or syncope secondary to cardiovascular cause; Carotid sinus massage (CSM) in patients age >40 years; Head-‍up tilt testing when there is suspicion of syncope due to OH or reflex syncope; and Blood tests when clinically indicated, e.g. haematocrit or haemoglobin when haemorrhage is suspected, oxygen saturation and blood gas analysis when hypoxia is suspected, troponin when cardiac-ischaemia related syncope is suspected, D-‍dimer when pulmonary embolism is suspected, etc.",

Tilt testing has an acceptable sensitivity and specificity when these are calculated in patients with true VVS or without a history of syncope. However, there is an inability to apply the test to populations with syncope of uncertain cause where it is hoped tilt testing might prove decisive. In other words, tilt testing offers little diagnostic value in patients for whom it is most needed. In these patients, a positive tilt test reveals a susceptibility to orthostatic stress. Clom = clomipramine; TNG = trinitroglycerin; VVS = vasovagal syncope. Clinical perspectives A negative tilt-‍table response does not exclude a diagnosis of reflex syncope. While sensitivity and specificity are at acceptable levels when measured in patients with VVS and healthy controls, in usual clinical settings of syncope of uncertain origin tilt testing suggests the presence of a hypotensive susceptibility, which may exist not only in reflex syncope but also with other causes of syncope including some forms of cardiac syncope. The concept of hypotensive susceptibility rather than diagnosis has important practical utility because the presence or absence of hypotensive susceptibility plays a major role in guiding pacemaker therapy in patients affected by reflex syncope and in the management of hypotensive therapies, which are frequently present in the elderly with syncope (see Treatment of reflex syncope).  A positive cardioinhibitory response to tilt testing predicts, with high probability, asystolic spontaneous syncope; this finding is relevant for therapeutic implications when cardiac pacing is considered. Conversely, the presence of a positive vasodepressor or mixed response or even a negative response does not exclude the presence of asystole during spontaneous syncope.  Tilt testing may be helpful in separating syncope with abnormal movements from epilepsy.  Tilt testing may have value in distinguishing syncope from falls. Tilt testing may be helpful in separating syncope from PPS. In suspected PPS, the tilt test should preferably be performed together with EEG monitoring; a normal EEG helps to confirm the diagnosis. In the absence of an EEG, a video recording will be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Tilt testing should not be used to assess efficacy of drug treatment.",

In general, more than 50% of patients with recurrent syncopal episodes in the 1 or 2 years before evaluation do not have syncopal recurrences in the following 1 or 2 years and, in those with recurrences, the burden of syncope decreases even more than 70% compared with the preceding period. The effect of education and reassurance is probably the most likely reason for the decrease in syncope after diagnostic evaluation. There is moderate evidence that discontinuation/‍reduction of hypotensive therapy targeting a systolic BP of 140 mmHg should be effective in reducing syncopal recurrences in patients with hypotensive susceptibility. Fludrocortisone, by increasing renal sodium re-‍absorption and expanding plasma volume, may counteract the physiological cascade leading to the orthostatic vasovagal reflex. Fludrocortisone should be titrated at a dosage from 0.05 to 0.2 mg once per day. The clinical benefit of fludrocortisone therapy should be balanced with the potential side effects of the drug. Midodrine (usually 2.5–10 mg, three times daily) has proved effective in small studies but none satisfied the criteria of a pivotal clinical trial. The most frequent side-‍effects that led to discontinuation of midodrine is supine hypertension, pilomotor reactions, and urinary problems (urinary retention, hesitancy, or urgency).

Establishing a relationship between symptoms and bradycardia should be the goal of the clinical evaluation of patients with syncope and a normal baseline ECG. The efficacy of pacing depends on the clinical setting. The fact that pacing may be effective does not mean that it is also always necessary. It must be emphasized that the decision to implant a pacemaker needs to be made in the clinical context of a benign condition that frequently affects young patients. Thus, cardiac pacing should be limited to a highly selected small proportion of patients affected by severe reflex syncope. Patients suitable for cardiac pacing are older with a history of recurrent syncope beginning in middle or older age and with frequent injuries, probably due to presentation without warning. Syncope recurrence is still expected to occur despite cardiac pacing in a minority of patients. Tilt test response is the strongest predictor of pacemaker efficacy. Patients with negative tilt test will have a risk of recurrence of syncope as low as that observed in patients paced for intrinsic AV block. On the contrary, patients with a positive tilt test will have a higher risk of recurrence of syncope with a large confidence range, which makes any estimate of the benefit of pacing uncertain.

The syncope unit should follow an internal protocol, which applies to diagnosis and management and is agreed by stakeholders. An equipped facility must be available. Essential equipment/tests:   12-lead ECG and 3-lead ECG monitoring. Non-‍invasive beat-‍to-‍beat BP monitor with recording facilities for subsequent analysis Tilt-‍table. Holter monitors/external loop recorders. ILRs Follow-‍up of ILRsa 24-hour BP monitoring. Basic autonomic function tests. Established procedures for:   Echocardiography EPS Stress test Neuroimaging tests. Specialists’ consultancies (cardiology, neurology, internal medicine, geriatric, psychology), when needed. Therapy Patients with syncope will receive their therapy under the care of the syncope unit unless expertise outside that of the unit is required. Database management The syncope unit is required to keep medical records that should also include follow-‍up when appropriate. The database will also offer the possibility of collaborative research with other syncope units. BP = blood pressure; ECG = electrocardiogram; ED = emergency department; EPS = electrophysiological study; ILR = implantable loop recorder; TLOC = transient loss of consciousness. aImplantation of loop recorders may be performed either by syncope unit physicians or by external cardiologists upon request of the syncope unit physicians.",

    "text": "Risk estimation should be individualized depending on the underlying cardiac diagnosis, ventricular and valvular function, functional class, presence of cyanosis, PAPs, and other factors. Indications for intervention (surgical or catheter) in the majority of patients do not differ in women who consider pregnancy compared with other patients. There are a few exceptions, such as some degree of aortic dilatation and severe asymptomatic MS. In women with a moderate or high-‍risk of complications during pregnancy (mWHO II–III, III, and IV), pre-‍pregnancy counselling and management during pregnancy and around delivery should be performed in an expert centre by a multidisciplinary team: the pregnancy heart team. All women with congenital or other possibly genetic heart disease should be offered foetal echocardiography in weeks 19–22 of pregnancy. A delivery plan should be made between 20–30 weeks of pregnancy detailing induction, management of labour, delivery, and post-‍partum surveillance. Induction of labour should be considered at 40 weeks of gestation in all women with cardiac disease. Vaginal delivery is the first choice for the majority of patients. Indications for caesarean section are: pre-‍term labour in patients on OACs aggressive aortic pathology acute intractable HF severe forms of PH (including Eisenmenger’s syndrome) Pregnancy termination should be discussed if there is a high-‍risk of maternal morbidity or mortality, and/‍or of foetal abnormality. Pregnancy, and consequently fertility treatment, is contraindicated in women with mWHO class IV. All patients with known cardiac or aortic disease need investigations and counselling about the risks of pregnancy pre-‍pregnancy or before assisted reproductive therapy. The following patients should be counselled against pregnancy: with a Fontan operation and additional comorbidities (ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias, or valve regurgitation with PAH severe systemic ventricular dysfunction (EF <30% or NYHA class III–IV). severe (re-)coarctation systemic right ventricle with moderate or severely decreased ventricular function with vascular Ehlers-‍Danlos with severe aortic dilatation or (history of) aortic dissection with severe MS (even when asymptomatic) Patients with severe AS who are symptomatic, or asymptomatic patients with impaired LV function or a pathological exercise test if LVEF does not normalize in women with previous PPCM. Women with a mechanical valve prosthesis are at high-‍risk of maternal morbidity (especially valve thrombosis and bleeding) and even mortality and should be managed by a pregnancy heart team in expert centres. LMWH should only be used when weekly monitoring of anti-‍Xa levels with dose adjustment is available. Women with HF during pregnancy should be treated according to current guidelines for non-‍pregnant patients, respecting contraindications for some drugs in pregnancy (see table of Recommendations for drug use in pregnancy). When inotropes or more advanced treatment is necessary, transport to an expert centre is recommended. It is recommended to inform women with DCM and HFrEF about the risk of deterioration of the condition during gestation and peripartum. In women with PPCM and DCM, subsequent pregnancy is not recommended if LVEF does not normalize. Patients with congenital LQTS and catecholaminergic polymorphic VT are recommended beta-‍blockers during pregnancy and post-‍partum. Initiation of antihypertensive drug treatment is recommended in all women with persistent elevation of BP ≥150/95 mmHg and at values >140/90 mmHg in women with: gestational hypertension (with or without proteinuria) pre-‍existing hypertension with the superimposition of gestational hypertension hypertension with subclinical organ damage or symptoms at any time during pregnancy. Women at high or moderate risk of pre-‍eclampsia should be advised to take 100–150 mg of acetylsalicylic acid daily from week 12 to week 36–37 in addition to their hypertension treatment. Methyldopa, labetalol, and calcium antagonists are recommended for the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy. LMWH is the agent of choice for VTE prophylaxis and treatment. Thrombolytics to treat thrombo-‍embolism should only be used in patients with severe hypotension or shock. In the case of an emergency, drugs that are not recommended by the pharmaceutical industry during pregnancy and breastfeeding should not be withheld from the mother. The potential risk of a drug and the possible benefit of the therapy must be weighed against each other.",

    "text": "Epidemiological data European epidemiological (e.g. registers such as ROPAC) data on women with CVDs and their outcomes, and the foetal risk during pregnancy and in the peripartum period, are important sources ofinformation. However, there is also a clear need for randomized controlled trials. In women with specific aortic diseases, the outcome is not well studied and the impact of treatment with beta-‍blockers during pregnancy is lacking. The impact of pregnancy in a woman with congenital or aortic disease on the long-‍term maternal and foetal outcome is not well studied. The impact of fertility treatment on pregnancy complications and maternal outcomes remains unknown.   Mechanical valve prostheses In women with mechanical valve prostheses, no prospective studies are available that compare different anticoagulation regimens. There are unresolved questions concerning LMWH, including optimal anti-‍Xa levels, the importance of peak vs. pre-‍dose levels, the best time intervals for anti-‍Xa monitoring, and the duration of use (first trimester or throughout pregnancy).   Coronary artery disease In women with CAD, the required delay of a subsequent pregnancy following MI is unknown. Furthermore, optimal management and follow-‍up of patients with P-‍SCAD is a burning clinical problem. This includes the decision for interventional therapy as well as counselling on the recurrence risk for repeated pregnancies.   Drugs The safety of antiplatelet agents used after PCI in pregnancy is not well known. There is a lack of randomized trials on the use of antiarrhythmic drugs and interventions during pregnancy. Data based on prospective randomized clinical trials in pregnant women to assess drug efficacy and safety are very limited. They will stay limited in some areas due to accepted ethical limitations. However, greater efforts can be made by prospective registries to answer burning treatment questions. Studies investigating the pharmacokinetic changes during pregnancy that modify clinical drug efficacy are required.   Cardiomyopathies The pathophysiology of PPCM has still to be explored in more detail. PPCM includes LV dysfunction due to several different causes and thus PPCM is not a well-‍described entity. The potential for recovery is often unclear and the risks of subsequent pregnancies are not well defined. For acute HF in the context of pregnancy there are almost no evidence-‍based treatments. More research is clearly needed.   Cardiac transplantation Evidence is also limited for pregnancies in patients post-‍cardiac transplantation.   Delivery Trials evaluating the level of surveillance at delivery and the warranted monitoring level after delivery are needed. Furthermore, the optimal mode of delivery is not clear for high-‍risk situations.   Hypertension It is still unclear whether mild–moderate hypertension in pregnancy should be pharmacologically treated. The current guidelines are based on expert consensus regarding thresholds to initiate antihypertensive medication. Prospective studies, even observational, in this area are needed.   Diagnostic pathways More data are needed on diagnostic pathways, specifically the place of D-‍dimers, in VTE. The value of monitoring anti-‍Xa values in patients with VTE (treatment) is unknown. Studies are needed on the benefit of using the combination of peak and trough levels. The lack of data regarding the length of anticoagulation after delivery is an unmet need.",

    "text": "3.0.0.0 What is new? Figure 1 Selected revised and new recommendations A) Selected revised recommendations Comment, comparison with 2011 2018 Strengthening modified World Health Organization (mWHO) classification of maternal risk. It is recommended to perform risk assessment in all women with cardiac diseases in childbearing age and before conception, using the mWHO classification of maternal risk. (IC) Upgrade in class of recommendation - Patients with severe MS should undergo intervention before pregnancy. Intervention is recommended before pregnancy in patients with MS and valve area <1.0 cm2. (IC) 2011, OACs were recommended during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters until the 36th week. Now separate recommendations for women with low and high dose are given for VKA use during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. During the 2nd and 3rd trimesters until the 36th week, VKA are recommended in women needing a low dose. (Low dose VKA: warfarin <5 mg/‍day (or phenprocoumon <3 mg/‍day or acenocoumarol <2 mg/‍day.) (IC) Sotalol deleted. Flecainide† or propafenone† are recommended for prevention of SVT in patients with WPW syndrome. (IC) Changed in high-‍risk patients from UFH to LMWH. Dosing based on body weight introduced. LMWH is the drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of VTE in all pregnant patients. (IB) It is recommended that the therapeutic dose of LMWH is based on body weight. (IC) Changes: dose adjustment of UFH or LMWH dose within 36 hours now recommended. In pregnant women on LMWH or UFH, it is recommended to perform weekly anti-‍Xa level monitoring or aPTT monitoring with dose adjustment (within 36 hours). (IC) Upgrade of recommendation, IIb to IIa. Catheter ablation with electroanatomic systems should be considered in experienced centres in case of drug- refractory and poorly tolerated SVT. (IIaC) Changed from D-‍dimers to imaging as the first line of investigation as D-‍dimers are unreliable in pregnancy. If compression ultrasound is negative, magnetic resonance venography should be considered to diagnose VTE. (IIaC) FDA categories A to X were used for all drugs in 2011. Decision-‍making based on former FDA categories is no longer recommended. (IIIC) “Pre-pregnancy surgery” is now deleted. Now also information on Turner syndrome with aortic diameter corrected for BSA. Pregnancy is not recommended in patients with severe dilatation of the aorta (heritable thoracic aortic disease such as Marfan syndrome >45 mm, bicuspid aortic valve >50 mm or >27 mm/m2 body surface area, Turner syndrome ASI >25 mm/m2 body surface area). (IIIC) B) Selected new recommendations Right heart catheterization is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of PAH. This can be performed during pregnancy but with very strict indications. (IC) LMWH in therapeutic dose is recommended in pregnant patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. (IC) In patients with pulmonary embolism, thrombolytic therapy is recommended only in severe hypotension or shock. (IC) In women at high-‍risk for thromboembolism, it is recommended to convert LMWH to UFH at least 36 hours prior to delivery and stop the UFH infusion 4–6 hours prior to anticipated delivery. aPTT should be normal before regional anaesthesia. (IC) In women at low-‍risk for thromboembolism on therapeutic LMWH, induction or caesarean section is recommended to be performed 24 hours after the last dose of LMWH. (IC) In women considering pregnancy and requiring heart valve surgery, it is recommended to choose the prosthesis in consultation with a pregnancy heart team. (IC) It is recommended to manage pregnancy in women with mechanical heart valves in a centre with a pregnancy heart team (IC) In treatment naive pregnant PAH patients, initiating treatment should be considered. (IIaC) In patients with (history of) aortic dissection caesarean delivery should be considered. (IIaC) β-‍blocker therapy throughout pregnancy should be considered in women with Marfan syndrome and other heritable thoracic aortic diseases. (IIaC) Induction of labour should be considered at 40 weeks gestation in all women with cardiac disease. (IIaC) In patients with PPCM, bromocriptine treatment may be considered to stop lactation and enhance recovery (LV function). (IIbB) Pregnancy is not recommended in patients with vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. (IIIC) Breastfeeding is not recommended in mothers who take antiplatelet agents other than low-‍dose aspirin (from Chapter 7, see Chapter 12) (III C) C) New concepts Enforcing mWHO classification of maternal risk. Introduction of the pregnancy heart team. More attention for assisted reproductive therapy. Discussion of the use of bromocriptine in PPCM. Introducing specific levels of surveillance based on low/medium/high-‍risk for arrhythmia with haemodynamic compromise at delivery. New information on pharmacokinetics in pregnancy, more detailed information on pharmacodynamics in animal experiments on all drugs (Supplementary Data). Perimortem caesarean section is discussed. Advice on contraception and termination of pregnancy in women with cardiac disease is now provided.

Dissection occurs most often in the last trimester of pregnancy (50%) or the early post-‍partum period (33%). The overall risk of a woman with Marfan syndrome having an aortic dissection associated with pregnancy is approximately 3%. Pregnancy should be avoided in Marfan patients with an aortic root diameter >45 mm. When the aorta is 40–45 mm, other factors should be considered such as family history of dissection and rate of aortic growth. In patients with a bicuspid aortic valve, if the ascending aorta is not visible with echocardiography, an MRI or CT should be performed pre-‍pregnancy. The risk of dissection is small. Risk factors are type of bicuspid aortic valve morphology, aortic dilatation, and CoA. Pregnancy should be avoided when the aorta diameter is >50 mm. In patients with Ehlers-‍Danlos syndrome, serious vascular complications occur almost exclusively in type IV (vascular). Maternal mortality is significant. Pregnancy is therefore considered as a very high-‍risk undertaking and not advised. Turner syndrome is associated with an increased risk of congenital heart disease, aortic dilatation, hypertension, diabetes and atherosclerotic events.

The risk of maternal cardiovascular complications in women with a bioprosthesis is low in those with no or minimal bioprosthesis dysfunction and uncompromised ventricular function. When significant bioprosthesis dysfunction is present, the risk of complications can be significant. In women with mechanical valves, pregnancy is associated with a very high-‍risk of complications (WHO risk classification III). A recent study from the UK reported a favourable outcome for mother and baby in only 28% of cases. The main risks are related to the need for anticoagulation therapy (valve thrombosis and haemorrhagic complications). Additional risks are related to ventricular and valvular dysfunction. Current evidence (lacking adequate randomized studies) indicates that VKAs throughout pregnancy, under strict INR control, is the safest regimen to prevent valve thrombosis. LMWH is possibly superior to UFH for preventing valve thrombosis. All anticoagulation regimens carry an increased risk of miscarriage and haemorrhagic complications, including post-‍partum haemorrhage and retroplacental bleeding leading to premature birth and foetal death. VKAs during the first trimester are associated with an increased risk of miscarriage compared to LMWH or UFH, and the live birth rate is lower, Vaginal delivery while the mother is on VKAs is contra-‍indicated because of the risk of foetal intracranial bleeding. The option to avoid pregnancy should be discussed with women who have a mechanical valve prosthesis. These high-‍risk pregnancies should be managed by a pregnancy heart team in an expert centre. The effectiveness of the anticoagulation regimen should be monitored weekly or every 2 weeks depending on the anticoagulation regimen (see Table 7: Drugs and safety data) and clinical follow-‍up including echocardiography should be performed monthly. Dyspnoea and/‍or an embolic event are reasons for immediate transthoracic echocardiography to search for valve thrombosis, usually followed by transoesophageal echocardiography. Planned delivery is necessary. Vaginal delivery requires a prior switch to i.v. heparin. The use of epidural anaesthesia requires a prolonged interruption of anticoagulant therapy, which may contra-‍indicate its use in women with a mechanical prosthesis. A planned caesarean section may therefore be considered as an alternative. Caesarean section should be performed if labour onset occurs while the patient is still on VKAs.",

The majority of CAD are of non-‍atherosclerotic causes, including pregnancy-‍related spontaneous coronary artery dissection (P-‍SCAD) (43%), angiographically normal coronary arteries (18%) and coronary thrombosis (17%). Clinical presentation is the same as the non-‍pregnant population. Serum troponin rise should suggest myocardial ischaemia. Where the ECG is non-‍diagnostic, echocardiography may be helpful. Management AMI management in pregnancy is similar to that in the general population, including revascularization techniques. In P-‍SCAD, enhanced vascular vulnerability should be considered when applying revascularization strategies. Therapy Low-‍dose aspirin appears to be safe, but there is little information regarding P2Y inhibitors. Clopidogrel should be used only when strictly necessary. The effects of ionizing radiation should not prevent primary PCI in pregnant patients with standard indications for revascularization in AMI. The majority of reports regarding STEMI management in pregnancy relate to bare metal stents, however, new generation drug-‍eluting stents (DES) are recommended according to the 2017 AMI STEMI Guidelines.

This Task Force recommends considering an SBP ≥170 mmHg or DBP ≥110 mmHg in a pregnant woman an emergency, and hospitalization is indicated.

The initial dose of LMWH for thromboprophylaxis should be based on the booking weight (body weight at the first antenatal appointment with the gynaecologist) Patients at high-‍risk for VTE should receive prophylactic enoxaparin at 0.5 IU/kg of body weight once daily or other LMWH at equivalent doses, according to local practice. In morbidly obese women a weight-‍based dosing instead of a fixed dosing is more appropriate in order to achieve adequate anti-‍Xa concentrations.",

    "text": "12.4.0.0 Management of acute VTE Pulmonary embolism For diagnosis, a high index of suspicion is important and all pregnant women with signs and symptoms suggestive of VTE should have objective testing performed urgently and receive therapeutic anticoagulation until the diagnosis is established. D-‍dimer levels increase physiologically with each trimester. Thus, a positive D-‍dimer test in pregnancy is not necessarily indicative of VTE and normal D-‍dimer concentrations have been reported in pregnant women with VTE, meaning that imaging remains the diagnostic test of choice during pregnancy. LMWH: In suspected DVT or PE, therapeutic LMWH should be given until the diagnosis is excluded by objective testing The recommended therapeutic dose is calculated on early pregnancy body weight aiming for 4–6 hour peak anti-‍Xa values of 0.6–1.2 IU/mL. UFH: Typically, UFH is used in the acute treatment of massive pulmonary emboli. (Chapter here). Thrombolysis: Thrombolytics should only be used in patients with severe hypotension or shock Fondaparinux: Fondaparinux (7.5 mg once a day in normal-‍weight pregnant woman) can be considered if there is an allergy or adverse response to LMWH (Chapter here). Post-‍partum management: In patients with recent PE, pre-‍partum heparin treatment should be restarted 6 hours after a vaginal birth and 12 hours after a caesarean delivery, if no significant bleeding has occurred, with subsequent overlap with VKAs for at least 5 days. VKAs may be started on the second day after delivery and continued for at least 3 months or for 6 months if PE occurred late in pregnancy. The INR should be between 2 and 3 and needs regular monitoring, ideally every 1–2 weeks. Acute deep vein thrombosis Leg swelling is a frequent finding in pregnancy, giving rise to the suspicion of DVT. Since DVT is left sided in >85% of cases swelling of the left leg is more suspicious. Three clinical variable – left leg presentation, >2 cm calf circumference difference, and first trimester – allowed a negative predictive value of 100% if ultrasound of the legs was negative. Compression ultrasound is the diagnostic imaging procedure of choice for suspected DVT in pregnancy with a high sensitivity and specificity for proximal DVT. In acute DVT, treatment with therapeutic doses of weight adjusted LMWH should be given twice daily (as in PE).",

I B For high-‍risk women it is recommended to give a weight-‍related prophylactic dose of LMWH (e.g. enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg once daily). I B A documented assessment of risk factors for VTE before pregnancy or in early pregnancy is recommended in all women. I C It is recommended that the therapeutic dose of LMWH is based on body weight. I C Thrombolytics to manage patients with pulmonary embolism is only recommended in patients with severe hypotension or shock. I C In high-‍risk women, it is recommended to convert LMWH to UFH at least 36 hours prior to delivery and stop the UFH infusion 4–6 hours prior to anticipated delivery. aPTT should be normal before regional anaesthesia. I C In low-‍risk women on therapeutic LMWH, induction or caesarean section is recommended to be performed 24 hours after the last dose of LMWH. I C For women after in vitro fertilization complicated by OHSS thromboprophylaxis with LMWH is recommended during the first trimester. I C In women who are on antenatal anticoagulation it should be considered to actively manage the third stage of labour with oxytocin. IIa C If compression ultrasound is negative, using magnetic resonance venography should be considered to diagnose pelvic thrombosis before using computed tomography pulmonary angiography or ventilation perfusion scanning. IIa C In women on therapeutic LMWH, planned delivery should be considered at around 39 weeks to avoid the risk of spontaneous labour while fully anticoagulated (LMWH is only partially reversed with protamine). IIa C Direct oral anticoagulants are not recommended in pregnancy. III B aPTT = activated partial thromboplastin time; LMWH = low molecular weight heparin; OHSS = ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome; UFH = unfractionated heparin; VTE = venous thromboembolism. a Class of recommendation - b Level of evidence.",

    "text": "13.0.0.0 Drugs during pregnancy and breastfeeding There are no uniform recommendations for the treatment of pregnant women yet. In case of emergency, drugs that are not recommended by international agencies during pregnancy and breastfeeding should not be withheld from the mother. The potential risk of a drug and the possible benefit of the therapy must be weighed against each other. US Food and Drug Administration classification On 30 June 2015 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) changed the previously used classification system for counselling of pregnant women and nursing mothers requiring drug therapy. The former A to X categories have been replaced by the Pregnancy and Lactation Labelling Rule (PLLR), which provides a descriptive risk summary and detailed information on animal and clinical data. PLLR applies immediately for prescription drugs approved after 30 June 2015, and the former FDA categories have to be removed for all other drugs until 29 June 2018. However, the former FDA categories will be present in the literature for a longer period of time, and therefore Table 7 (Drugs and safety data) provides information on both systems. The previous classification consisted of category A (safest) to Category D (evidence of human foetal risk) and, X (known danger—do not use!). Drug use in pregnancy Recommendations Classa Levelb Before pharmacological treatment in pregnancy is started, it is recommended to check drug Table 7 for clinical safety data. I C In the absence of clinical safety data it is recommended to check electronic drug table (www.safefetus.com) for preclinical safety data. I C In the absence of adequate human safety data, decision-‍making should be based on individual drug efficacy and safety profile, and available animal data, and the decision must be made together with the patient.   IIa C Decision-‍making based on former FDA categories alone is no longer recommended. III C FDA = Food and Drug Administration. a Class of recommendation - b Level of evidence.

    "text": "Myocardial revascularization is performed for the relief of symptoms of myocardial ischaemia and the improvement of prognosis. In SCAD, the prognostic benefit is dependent on the extent of myocardium subject to ischaemia. The prognostic and symptomatic benefits of myocardial revascularization critically depend on the completeness of revascularization. Therefore, the ability to achieve complete revascularization is a key issue when choosing the appropriate treatment strategy. Apart from issues of individual operative risk and technical feasibility, diabetes mellitus and the anatomical complexity of CAD determine the relative benefits of PCI and CABG. The SYNTAX score is the recommended tool to gauge the anatomical complexity of coronary disease. In some instances, both PCI and CABG are equally reasonable, or sometimes even equally problematic, options. This calls for the Heart Team to be consulted to develop individualized treatment concepts, with respect for the preferences of the patient who has been informed about early and late outcomes. Timely PCI of the culprit lesion remains the mainstay of treatment of ACS. After PCI of the culprit lesion in ACS, the choice of further revascularization modality should follow the criteria applied to patients with SCAD. Radial access is preferred for any PCI irrespective of clinical presentation, unless there are overriding procedural considerations. DES are recommended for any PCI irrespective of clinical presentation, lesion type, anticipated duration of DAPT, or concomitant anticoagulant therapy. Even though 6 months of DAPT is generally recommended after PCI in SCAD and 12 months of DAPT after ACS, the type and duration of DAPT should be individualized according to the ischaemic and bleeding risks, and appropriately adapted during follow-‍up. Based on this judgement, treatment durations for DAPT after DES that are as short as 1 month or even as long as lifelong may be reasonable. Off-‍pump surgery with no-‍touch aorta for high-‍risk patients should be considered when expertise exists. Multiple arterial grafting should be considered using the radial artery for high-‍grade stenosis and/‍or BIMA grafting for patients who do not have an increased risk of sternal wound infection.",

    "text": "Diagnostic tools to guide myocardial revascularization Further studies investigating the role of novel, combined, non-‍invasive anatomical and functional imaging are needed, such as randomized clinical trials with CT-‍FFR in patients with suspected and known CAD, as well as further clinical investigation of perfusion CT. Randomized trials comparing iwFR-‍based management of patients with intermediate-‍grade stenosis compared with medical therapy are missing. Further study of whole-‍cardiac cycle Pd/Pa for the guidance of revascularization in the setting of randomized clinical trials is also required. Further studies including randomized trials are needed to assess the value of functional vs. anatomical guidance for CABG.   Revascularization for stable coronary artery disease Revascularization for stable coronary artery disease It remains to be determined whether revascularization by PCI improves prognosis in patients with SCAD. The ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches) study (NCT01471522) is currently recruiting 5000 patients with SCAD and evidence of moderate-‍to severe ischaemia detected by non-‍invasive imaging, who are randomized before coronary angiography to medical therapy or an invasive strategy to detect differences in the primary endpoint of death or MI. Current techniques rely on coronary angiography and the detection of ischaemia-producing lesions. However, future adverse events are related at least in part to non-‍flow limiting, vulnerable plaques. Better identification of vulnerable plaques and the development of appropriate treatment strategies is needed. Along the same lines, the completeness and timing of revascularization are not well defined, and neither are the roles of residual ischaemia and lesions. Moreover, we need more research on the use of the SYNTAX and other scores for informing treatment allocation, as well as dedicated trials in specific subsets. Very long-‍term, extended follow-‍up (10 years) of trials comparing PCI and CABG, particularly in the setting of LM disease, will provide further insights into the relative merits of both revascularization techniques.   Revascularization in non-‍ST-‍elevation acute coronary syndrome In the setting of NSTE-‍ACS, there are no dedicated prospective studies on the revascularization strategy with multivessel disease. Thus, current recommendations on the choice of lesions to be treated and treatment modality (PCI or CABG) are based on an analogy to findings obtained in SCAD or STEMI. Likewise, the prognostic role of FFR and iwFR in guiding myocardial revascularization needs additional clarification.   Revascularization in ST-‍segment elevation myocardial infarction Patients undergoing primary PCI benefit from full revascularization, but the optimal timing of treatment of the non-‍culprit lesion is not known. More studies evaluating the assessment of non-‍culprit lesions by FFR or iwFR at the time of acute PCI, and studies investigating whether intravascular imaging guidance of primary PCI can improve the outcomes of STEMI patients, are needed. Future trials of improved thrombus aspiration technologies may address the role of this strategy in patients with high-‍risk features, such as large thrombus Burden.   Myocardial revascularization in patients with heart failure There is no RCT comparing revascularization with PCI vs. CABG in patients with HF. There is limited evidence on the role of active MCS in patients with cardiogenic shock compared with standard therapy.   Revascularization in patients with diabetes Following successful revascularization, the rate of events during follow-‍up remains high in patients with diabetes, independent of the mode of revascularization. Future research should be focused on identifying new disease-‍ modifying therapies to influence the progression of vascular disease in this high-‍risk cohort.   Revascularization in patients with chronic kidney disease Thus far, patients with CKD have been excluded from randomized trials on myocardial revascularization, hence current data are based on observational studies only. A randomized trial on optimal long-‍term revascularization strategies in patients with moderate-‍to-severe stress-‍induced ischaemia and severe CKD is currently ongoing (ISCHEMIA-‍CKD, https://clinicaltrials.gov/‍ct2/‍show/‍NCT01985360).Moreover, additional randomized evidence on optimal strategies for CIN prevention is needed.   Revascularization in patients requiring valve interventions In patients with concomitant valvular and coronary disease, the possibility of future transcatheter therapy for the aortic and mitral valves has made a significant impact on decision-‍making for patients with predominantly coronary disease with moderate valve lesions. However, there is currently little evidence on this topic. The need for and timing of PCI in patients undergoing TAVI is also an area with limited evidence. The long-‍term outcomes of patients with concomitant surgical repair of ischaemic MR is also awaited.   Arrhythmias The duration of anticoagulation and their combination with antiplatelet therapy in patients with new-‍onset AF after PCI or CABG has not been studied sufficiently. Likewise, the role of routine left atrial exclusion at surgery for the prevention of stroke is currently unclear.   Procedural aspects of coronary artery bypass grafting The role of FFR and iwFR in guiding surgical revascularization needs further investigation into whether it improves clinical outcomes. Likewise, there are insufficient data on the impact of intraoperative assessment of graft flow on outcomes. In view of the limitations of observational studies comparing BIMA with SIMA and the limitations of the ART trial, the ROMA (Randomization of Single vs. Multiple Arterial Grafts) trial is recruiting to answer the question of whether the use of additional arterial conduits (either BIMA or radial artery) translates into superior clinical outcomes when compared with SIMA supplemented by SVG only. Hybrid procedures, which combine minimally invasive arterial grafting with PCI, proved feasible and safe. However, multicentre studies are required to prove the efficacy and superiority of this approach in stable, multivessel coronary disease.   Antithrombotic treatments The value of pre-‍hospital pre-‍treatment with prasugrel in STEMI patients, as well as the safety and efficacy of ticagrelor given at hospital admission in NSTE-‍ACS patients, has not been addressed in dedicated randomized studies. The safety and efficacy of short-‍term potent antiplatelet treatment with either prasugrel or ticagrelor in SCAD patients is unknown, and is subject to ongoing clinical trials [the ALPHEUS (Assessment of Loading With the P2Y12 Inhibitor Ticagrelor or Clopidogrel to Halt Ischemic Events in Patients Undergoing Elective Coronary Stenting) trial: NCT02617290 and the SASSICAIA (Comparison of Loading Strategies With Antiplatelet Drugs in Patients Undergoing Elective Coronary Intervention) trial: NCT02548611].The clinical benefit of a short-‍term DAPT duration followed by long-‍term ticagrelor monotherapy (and stopping aspirin) remains unknown. The ongoing GLOBAL LEADERS (Long-‍term ticagrelor monotherapy versus standard dual antiplatelet therapy followed by aspirin monotherapy in patients undergoing biolimus-‍eluting stent implantation) and TWILIGHT (Ticagrelor With Aspirin or Alone in High-‍Risk Patients After Coronary Intervention) trials aim to close this gap in our current knowledge (NCT01813435 and NCT02270242, respectively).   Medical therapy, secondary prevention, and strategies for follow-‍up In all studies to date on the optimal follow-‍up after PCI, the gain from discovering patients with restenosis is obscured by the high rate of false positive exercise ECG tests indicating ischaemia. Therefore, simple exercise ECG testing is not recommended for follow-‍up and a non-‍invasive imaging approach is preferred. Specific studies to clarify which subset of patients benefits more from a specific follow-‍up approach are missing. More studies are needed to assess the role of CT angiography in patient surveillance after myocardial revascularization.",

    "text": "6.0.0.0 Revascularization for SCAD 6.1.0.0 Overview Myocardial revascularization is performed for relief of symptoms of myocardial ischaemia and improvement of prognosis. In stable coronary artery disease, the prognostic benefit is dependent on the extent of myocardium subject to ischaemia. With the exception of subtotal stenoses in a major coronary vessel, angiography alone does not suffice to establish the indication for PCI, but documentation of ischaemia or haemodynamic relevance is required. Indications for revascularization in patients with stable angina or silent ischaemia are shown in the Table here. Whether conservative therapy, PCI or CABG is preferred should depend on the risk– benefit ratios of these treatment strategies, weighting the risks of peri-‍procedural complications against improvements in health-‍related quality of life, as well as long-‍term freedom from death, MI or repeat revascularization. Predicted surgical mortality, anatomical complexity of CAD, and the anticipated completeness of revascularization are important criteria for decision making with respect to the type of revascularization (see Table here). Individualized treatment decisions should respect the range of predicted surgical risks in the major RCTs which inform the choice of revascularization modality (Table 5). Apart from these issues of individual operative risk and technical feasibility, diabetes mellitus (see Chapter) and anatomical complexity of CAD, as assessed by the SYNTAX score (calculator at http://www.syntaxscore.com), determine the relative benefits of PCI and CABG. Moreover, the ability to achieve complete revascularization is a key issue when choosing the appropriate treatment strategy.

Optimal treatment of STEMI should be based on the implementation of regional networks between hospitals with various levels of technology, connected by an efficient ambulance service. The goal of these networks is to provide optimal care while minimizing delays–as summarized in Figure 5–in order to improve clinical outcomes. Figure 5 Modes of patient’s medical contact, components of ischaemia time and flowchart for reperfusion strategy selection The recommended mode of patient presentation is by alerting the EMS (call national emergency number: 112 or similar number according to region). When STEMI diagnosis is made in the out-‍of-‍hospital setting (via EMS) or in a non-‍PCI centre, the choice of reperfusion strategy is based on the estimated time from STEMI diagnosis to PCI-‍mediated reperfusion (wire crossing). System delay for patients alerting the EMS starts at the time of phone alert, although FMC occurs when the EMS arrives at the scene.

    "text": "BP, epidemiology, and risk. Globally, over 1 billion people have hypertension. As populations age and adopt more sedentary lifestyles, the worldwide prevalence of hypertension will continue to rise towards 1.5 billion by 2025. Elevated BP is the leading global contributor to premature death, accounting for almost 10 million deaths in 2015, 4.9 million due to ischaemic heart disease and 3.5 million due to stroke. Hypertension is also a major risk factor for heart failure, AF, CKD, PAD, and cognitive decline. Definition of hypertension. The classification of BP and the definition of hypertension is unchanged from previous European Guidelines and is defined as an office SBP ≥140 and/‍or DBP ≥90 mmHg, which is equivalent to a 24 h ABPM average of ≥130/80 mmHg, or a HBPM average ≥135/85mmHg. Screening and diagnosis of hypertension. Hypertension is usually asymptomatic (hence the term ‘silent killer’). Because of its high prevalence, screening programmes should be established to ensure that BP is measured in all adults at least every 5 years, and more frequently in people with a high–normal BP. When hypertension is suspected because of an elevated screening BP, the diagnosis of hypertension should be confirmed either by repeated office BP measurements over a number of visits or by out-of-office BP measurement using 24 h ABPM or HBPM. The importance of cardiovascular risk assessment and detection of HMOD. Other CV risk factors such as dyslipidaemia and metabolic syndrome frequently cluster with hypertension. Thus, unless the patient is already at high or very high risk due to established CVD, formal CV risk assessment is recommended using the SCORE system. However, it is important to recognise that the presence of HMOD, especially LVH, CKD, or advanced retinopathy, further increases the risk of CV morbidity and mortality, and should be screened for as part of risk assessment in hypertensive patients because the SCORE system alone may underestimate their risk. Think: could this patient have secondary hypertension? For most people with hypertension, no underlying cause will be detected. Secondary (and potentially remediable) causes of hypertension are more likely to be present in people with young onset of hypertension (<40 years), people with severe or treatment resistant hypertension, or people who suddenly develop significant hypertension in midlife on a background of previously normal BP. Such patients should be referred for specialist evaluation. Treatment of hypertension: importance of lifestyle interventions. The treatment of hypertension involves lifestyle interventions and drug therapy. Many patients with hypertension will require drug therapy, but lifestyle interventions are important because they can delay the need for drug treatment or complement the BP-‍lowering effect of drug treatment. Moreover, lifestyle interventions such as sodium restriction, alcohol moderation, healthy eating, regular exercise, weight control, and smoking cessation all have health benefits beyond their impact on BP. When to consider drug treatment of hypertension. The treatment thresholds for hypertension are now less conservative than they were in previous Guidelines. We now recommend that patients with low-‍moderate-‍risk grade 1 hypertension (office BP 140–159/90–99), even if they do not have HMOD, should now receive drug treatment if their BP is not controlled after a period of lifestyle intervention alone. For higher-‍risk patients with grade 1 hypertension, including those with HMOD, or patients with higher grades of hypertension (e.g. grade 2 hypertension, ≥160/100 mmHg), we recommend initiating drug treatment alongside lifestyle interventions. These recommendations apply to all adults aged <80 years. Special considerations in frail and older patients. It is increasingly recognised that biological rather than chronological age, as well as consideration of frailty and independence, are important determinants of the tolerability of and likely benefit from BP-‍lowering medications. It is important to note that even in the very old (i.e. >80 years), BP-‍lowering therapy reduces mortality, stroke, and heart failure. Thus, these patients should not be denied treatment or have treatment withdrawn simply on the basis of age. For people >80 years who have not yet received treatment for their BP, treatment is recommended when their office SBP is ≥160 mmHg, provided that the treatment is well tolerated. How low should SBP be lowered? This has been a hotly debated topic. A key discussion point is the balance of potential benefits vs. potential harm or adverse effects. This is especially important whenever BP targets are lowered, as there is a greater potential for harm to exceed benefit. Thus, in these Guidelines, we recommend a target range. The evidence strongly suggests that lowering office SBP to <140 mmHg is beneficial for all patient groups, including independent older patients. There is also evidence to support targeting SBP to 130 mmHg for most patients, if tolerated. Even lower SBP levels (<130 mmHg) will be tolerated and potentially beneficial for some patients, especially to further reduce the risk of stroke. SBP should not be targeted to <120 mmHg because the balance of benefit vs. harm becomes concerning at these levels of treated SBP. BP targets in old and very old patients. As discussed above, independence, frailty, and comorbidities will all influence treatment decisions, especially in older (≥65 years) and very old (>80 years) patients. The desired SBP target range for all patients aged >65 years is 130–139 mmHg. This is lower than in previous Guidelines and may not be achievable in all older patients, but any BP lowering towards this target is likely to be beneficial provided that the treatment is well tolerated. BP targets in patients with diabetes and/‍or CKD. The BP treatment targets for patients with diabetes or kidney disease have been a moving target in previous Guidelines because of seemingly contradictory results from major outcome trials and meta analyses. For diabetes, targeting the SBP to <140 mmHg and towards 130 mmHg, as recommended for all other patient groups, is beneficial on major outcomes. Moreover, targeting SBP to <130 mmHg, for those who will tolerate it, may further reduce the risk of stroke but not other major outcomes. SBP should not be <120 mmHg. For patients with CKD, the evidence suggests that the target BP range should be 130–139 mmHg. How low should DBP be lowered? The optimal DBP target has been less well defined, but a DBP target of <80 mmHg is recommended. Some patients with stiff arteries and isolated systolic hypertension will already have DBP levels below this target. These are high-‍risk patients and the low DBP should not discourage treatment of their elevated SBP to the recommended target, provided that treatment is well tolerated. The need to do better on BP control. A key message in these Guidelines is the need to do better at improving BP control rates. Despite the overwhelming evidence of treatment benefit, on average, <50% of patients with treated hypertension achieve an SBP target of <140 mmHg. Physician inertia (inadequate uptitration of treatment, especially from monotherapy) and poor patient adherence to treatment (especially when based on multiple pills) are now recognised as the major factors contributing to poor BP control. Start treatment in most patients with two drugs, not one. Monotherapy is usually inadequate therapy for most people with hypertension; this will be especially true now that the BP treatment targets for many patients are lower than in previous Guidelines. These Guidelines have set out to normalize the concept that initial therapy for the majority of patients with hypertension should be with a combination of two drugs, not a single drug. The only exception would be in a limited number of patients with a lower baseline BP close to their recommended target, who might achieve that target with a single drug, or in some frailer old or very old patients in whom more gentle reduction of BP may be desirable. Evidence suggests that this approach will improve the speed, efficiency, and consistency of initial BP lowering and BP control, and is well tolerated by patients. A single-‍pill strategy to treat hypertension. Poor adherence to longer-‍term BP-‍lowering medication is now recognised as a major factor contributing to poor BP control rates. Research has shown a direct correlation between the number of BP-‍lowering pills and poor adherence to medications. Moreover, SPC therapy has been shown to improve adherence to treatment. SPC therapy is now the preferred strategy for initial two-‍drug combination treatment of hypertension and for three-‍drug combination therapy when required. This will control the BP of most patients with a single pill and could transform BP control rates. A simplified drug treatment algorithm. We have simplified the treatment strategy so that patients with uncomplicated hypertension and many patients with a variety of comorbidities (e.g. HMOD, diabetes, PAD, or cerebrovascular disease) receive similar medication. We recommend a combination of an ACE inhibitor or ARB with a CCB or thiazide/thiazide-‍like diuretic as initial therapy for most patients. For those requiring three drugs, we recommend a combination of an ACE inhibitor or ARB with a CCB and a thiazide/thiazide-‍like diuretic. We recommend that beta-‍blockers be used when there is a specific indication for their use (e.g. angina, post-‍myocardial infarction, HFrEF, or when heart rate control is required). Hypertension in women and in pregnancy. In women with hypertension who are planning pregnancy, ACE inhibitors or ARBs and diuretics should be avoided, and the preferred medications to lower BP, if required, include alpha-‍methyl dopa, labetalol, or CCBs. The same drugs are suitable if BP lowering is required in pregnant women. ACE inhibitors or ARBs should not be used in pregnant women. Is there a role for device-‍based therapy for the treatment of hypertension? A number of device-‍based interventions have been developed and studied for the treatment of hypertension. To date, the results from these studies have not provided sufficient evidence to recommend their routine use. Consequently, the use of device-‍based therapies is not recommended for the routine treatment of hypertension, unless in the context of clinical studies and RCTs, until further evidence regarding their safety and efficacy becomes available.. Managing cardiovascular disease risk in hypertensive patients beyond BP: statins. For hypertensive patients at moderate CVD risk or higher, or those with established CVD, BP lowering alone will not optimally reduce their risk. These patients would also benefit from statin therapy, which further reduces the risk of a myocardial infarction by approximately one-‍third and stroke by approximately one-‍quarter, even when BP is controlled. Similar benefits have been seen in hypertensive patients at the border between low and moderate-‍risk. Thus, many more hypertensive patients would benefit from statin therapy than are currently receiving this treatment. Managing cardiovascular disease risk in hypertensive patients beyond BP: antiplatelet therapy. Antiplatelet therapy, especially low-‍dose aspirin, is recommended for secondary prevention in hypertensive patients, but is not recommended for primary prevention (i.e. in patients without CVD).",

Changes in recommendations 2013 2018 Diagnosis Office BP is recommended for screening and diagnosis of hypertension. Diagnosis It is recommended to base the diagnosis of hypertension on: Repeated office BP measurements; or Out-of-office BP measurement with ABPM and/‍or HBPM if logistically and economically feasible. Treatment thresholds High-‍normal BP (130–139/85–89 mmHg): Unless the necessary evidence is obtained it is not recommended to initiate anti-‍hypertensive drug therapy at high normal BP. Treatment thresholds High-‍normal BP (130–139/85–89 mmHg): Drug treatment may be considered when CV risk is very high due to established CVD, especially CAD. Treatment thresholds Treatment of low-‍risk grade 1 hypertension: Initiation of antihypertensive drug treat-‍ment should also be considered in grade 1 hypertensive patients at low–moderate-‍risk, when BP is within this range at several repeated visits or elevated by ambulatory BP criteria, and remains within this range despite a reasonable period of time with lifestyle measures. Treatment thresholds Treatment of low-‍risk grade 1 hypertension: In patients with grade 1 hypertension at low–moderate-‍risk and without evidence of HMOD, BP-‍lowering drug treatment is recommended if the patient remains hypertensive after a period of lifestyle intervention. Treatment thresholds Older patients Antihypertensive drug treatment may be considered in the elderly (at least when younger than 80 years) when SBP is in the 140–159 mmHg range, provided that antihypertensive treatment is well tolerated. Treatment thresholds Older patients BP-‍lowering drug treatment and lifestyle intervention is recommended in fit older patients (>65 years but not >80 years) when SBP is in the grade 1 range (140–159 mmHg), provided that treatment is well tolerated. BP treatment targets An SBP goal of <140 mmHg is recommended. BP treatment targets It is recommended that the first objective of treatment should be to lower BP to <140/90 mmHg in all patients and, provided that the treatment is well tolerated, treated BP values should be targeted to 130/80 mmHg or lower in most patients. In patients <65 years it is recommended that SBP should be lowered to a BP range of 120–129 mmHg in most patients. BP treatment targets in older patients (65–80 years) An SBP target of between 140–150 mmHg is recommended for older patients (65–80 years). BP treatment targets in older patients (65–80 years) In older patients (≥65 years), it is recommended that SBP should be targeted to a BP range of 130–139 mmHg. BP treatment targets in patients aged over 80 years An SBP target between 140–150 mmHg should be considered in people older than 80 years, with an initial SBP ≥160 mmHg, provided that they are in good physical and mental condition. BP treatment targets in patients aged over 80 years An SBP target range of 130–139 mmHg is recommended for people older than 80 years, if tolerated. DBP targets A DBP target of <90 mmHg is always recommended, except in patients with diabetes, in whom values <85 mmHg are recommended. DBP targets A DBP target of <80 mmHg should be considered for all hypertensive patients, independent of the level of risk and comorbidities. Initiation of drug treatment Initiation of antihypertensive therapy with a two-‍drug combination may be considered in patients with markedly high baseline BP or at high CV risk. Initiation of drug treatment It is recommended to initiate an anti-‍hypertensive treatment with a two-‍drug combination, preferably in a SPC. The exceptions are frail older patients and those at low-‍risk and with grade 1 hypertension (particularly if SBP is <150 mmHg). Resistant hypertension Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, amiloride, and the alpha-‍1 blocker doxazosin should be considered if no contraindication exists. Resistant hypertension Recommended treatment of resistant hypertension is the addition of low-‍dose spironolactone to existing treatment, or the addition of further diuretic therapy if intolerant to spironolactone, with either eplerenone, amiloride, higher-‍dose thiazide/thiazide-‍like diuretic or a loop diuretic, or the addition of bisoprolol or doxazosin. Device-‍based therapy for hypertension In case of ineffectiveness of drug treatment, invasive procedures such as renal denervation and baroreceptor stimulation may be considered. Device-‍based therapy for hypertension Use of device-‍based therapies is not recommended for the routine treatment of hypertension, unless in the context of clinical studies and RCTs, until further evidence regarding their safety and efficacy becomes available.

    "text": "Hypertension often clusters with other CV risk factors such and dyslipidaemia and glucose intolerance, which have a multiplicative effect on CV risk. Quantification of total CV risk is important for the risk stratification of patients with hypertension, to determine whether additional treatments such as statins and anti-‍platelet therapies may be indicated to further reduce CV risk (see section here). Classification of CV risk according to the SCORE system is recommended (Table 6). Hypertension and cardiovascular risk assessment Recommendations Classa Levelb CV risk assessment with the SCORE system is recommended for hypertensive patients who are not already at high or very high risk due to established CVD, renal disease, or diabetes, a markedly elevated single risk factor (e.g. cholesterol), or hypertensive LVH.

    "text": "BP may be measured in the doctor’s office, at home or by ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). In all cases, it is important that BP is measured carefully using a validated device (Table 7). Table 7 Office blood pressure measurement Patients should be seated comfortably in a quiet environment for 5 min before beginning BP measurements. Three BP measurements should be recorded, 1–2 min apart, and additional measurements only if the first two readings differ by >10 mmHg. BP is recorded as the average of the last two BP readings. Additional measurements may have to be performed in patients with unstable BP values due to arrhythmias, such as in patents with AF, in whom manual auscultatory methods should be used as most automated devices have not been validated for BP measurement in patients with AF.a Use a standard bladder cuff (12–13 cm wide and 35 cm long) for most patients, but have larger and smaller cuffs available for larger (arm circumference >32 cm) and thinner arms, respectively. The cuff should be positioned at the level of the heart, with the back and arm supported to avoid muscle contraction and isometric exercise-‍dependant increases in BP. When using auscultatory methods, use phase I and V (sudden reduction/‍disappearance) Korotkoff sounds to identify SBP and DBP, respectively. Measure BP in both arms at the first visit to detect possible between-‍arm differences. Use the arm with the higher value as the reference. Measure BP 1 minute and 3 min after standing from seated position in all patients at the first measurement to exclude orthostatic hypotension. Lying and standing BP measurements should also be considered in subsequent visits in older people, people with diabetes, and people with other conditions in which orthostatic hypotension may frequently occur.

    "text": "Despite the availability of proven and effective drug therapies for hypertension, the global rates of BP control remain poor.  Thus, there is an urgent need to address the factors contributing to the poor control of BP in treated hypertensive patients, especially treatment inertia (clinician failure to up-‍titrate treatment) and poor patient adherence to multiple medications. The drug treatment algorithm has been developed to provide a simple and pragmatic treatment recommendation for the treatment of hypertension, based on a few key principles and recommendations: 1. The initiation of treatment in most patients should be with a single pill combination (SPC) of two drugs, to improve the speed, efficiency, and predictability of BP control. This normalises the concept that effective initial treatment of hypertension requires at least 2 drugs for most patients. 2. The preferred two-‍drug combinations are a RAS blocker (ACE-‍inhibitor or ARB) with a CCB or a diuretic. A beta-‍blocker in combination with a diuretic or any drug from the other major classes is an alternative, when there is a specific indication for a beta-‍blocker, e.g. angina, post-‍myocardial infarction, heart failure, or heartrate control. 3. Monotherapy should usually only be used as initial therapy for; (i) low-‍risk patients with stage 1 hypertension whose SBP is <150 mmHg, (ii) when it is decided to treat very high-‍risk patients with high-‍normal BP, or (iii) frail older patients. 4. A three-‍drug SPC comprising an RAS blocker + CCB + diuretic, should be used if BP is not controlled by a two-‍drug SPC. 5. Spironolactone is the preferred initial treatment for resistant hypertension, unless contraindicated (see section here). 6. Other classes of antihypertensive drugs may be used in the rare circumstances in which BP is not controlled by the above treatment strategy. The core drug treatment algorithm is shown in Figure 4, and variations in the algorithm for patients with specific comorbidities are shown in Figures 5 to 8. The drug-‍treatment strategy for patients with hypertension should be based on these algorithms unless there are contraindications to these drugs (Table 19).",

Low dose spironolactone (25-50mg per day) is an effective treatment for resistant hypertension, however, its efficacy and safety has not been established in patients with significant renal impairment. Consequently, the use of spironolactone for resistant hypertension should usually be restricted to patients with an eGFR ≥45 mL/‍min and a plasma potassium concentration of ≤4.5 mmol/‍L. Electrolytes and eGFR should be monitored soon after initiation. Amiloride (10–20 mg/‍day) has recently been shown to be as effective as spironolactone 25–50 mg daily) but has the same limitations with regard to renal function and potassium. A loop diuretic should replace thiazides/thiazide-‍like diuretics if the eGFR is <30 mL/‍min.

For stable patients, HBPM and electronic communication with the physician may provide an alternative to reduce the frequency of visits. It is advisable to assess risk factors and asymptomatic organ damage at least every 2 years. Table 27 Interventions that may improve drug adherence in hypertension Physician level Provide information on the risks of hypertension and the benefits of treatment, as well as agreeing a treatment strategy to achieve and maintain BP control using lifestyle measures and a single-‍pill–based treatment strategy when possible (information material, programmed learning, computer-‍aided counselling) Empowerment of the patient Feedback on behavioural and clinical improvements Assessment and resolution of individual barriers to adherence Collaboration with other healthcare providers, especially nurses and pharmacists Patient level Self-monitoring of BP (including telemonitoring) Group sessions Instruction combined with motivational strategies Self-‍management with simple patient-guided systems Use of reminders Obtain family, social, or nurse support Provision of drugs at worksite Drug-‍treatment level Simplification of the drug regimen favouring the use of SPC therapy Reminder packaging Health-‍system level Support the development of monitoring systems (telephone follow-‍up, home visits, telemonitoring of home BP) Support financially the collaboration between healthcare providers (pharmacists, nurses) Reimbursement of SPC pills Development of national databases, including prescription data, available for physicians and pharmacists Accessibility to drugs BP = blood pressure; SPC = single-‍pill combination.",
