After age 74, FS screening should be discontinued There is limited evidence to support the efficacy of colonoscopy in reducing CRC incidence and mortality Colonoscopy screening may not be as effective in the right colon as in other segments of large bowel The age range is 50–74 years, with the optimal age for a single colonoscopy of ~55 years The optimal interval should not be less than 10 years and may be extended up to 20 years There is no evidence of extra benefit for adding a once-‍only sigmoidoscopy to FOBT screening New screening technologies are still under evaluation Computed tomography (CT) colonography, stool DNA testing and capsule endoscopy should not be used for screening in the average-‍risk population",

    "text": "STAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT Overview Once a colon cancer is diagnosed, clinical examination, laboratory tests and instrumental screening should be carried out in order to detect or to exclude metastatic disease Clinical examination may show visceromegaly (hepatomegaly or lymphadenopathy), ascites and/‍or synchronous tumours (mainly in women: Ovarian, endometrial and breast cancer) Ultrasonography of the liver and abdomen may be useful, but CT scan is usually more appropriate to detect metastatic spread to the liver or complications related to the tumour (e.g. perforation, fistula, obstruction) Sensitivity of CT scan in detecting peritoneal implants is relatively poor Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be useful for locally advanced tumours and could also be the preferred first-‍line investigation for evaluating liver metastases in patients who have not previously undergone therapy The routine use of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is not recommended at the time of initial diagnosis Pre-‍operative evaluation of the serum marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is useful for post-‍operative follow-‍up of CRC (or for use in treatment of metastatic disease) It has a low predictive value for diagnosis in asymptomatic patients but may have prognostic value in the pre-‍operative setting (>5 ng/dL suggests a worse prognosis) An increased pre-‍operative CEA value not normalised after one month following surgical resection may indicate persistent disease Surgical staging includes: Assessment of liver metastases Nodal spread of disease Extension of tumour through the bowel wall and onto adjacent structures For adequate pN-‍staging, at least 12 nodes should be examined Intra-‍operative ultrasound is a more accurate assessment for liver metastases The pathological stage must be reported according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/‍Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) tumour node metastisis (TNM) staging classification system (8th edition) (see tables) Although local failure rates are very low in colon cancer, systemic recurrence following surgery is frequent and is very often the ultimate cause of death The prognosis of colon cancer is influenced by multiple factors, including: Stage (TNM classification), including degree of penetration of the tumour through the bowel wall and the presence or absence of nodal involvement Pathohistological characteristics, such as grading, lymphatic or venous or perineural invasion, lymphoid inflammatory response and involvement of resection margins (Dukes’ and TNM classification) Pre-‍treatment serum levels of CEA and/‍or carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) Various molecular characteristics, including: Mismatch repair (MMR) system/microsatellite status (MMR deficient [dMMR]/ microsatellite instability [MSI]), p53, KRAS and bcl-2 expression, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), proliferation index and aneuploidy are under evaluation for their single or combined prognostic value in high-risk conditions Risk assessment plays an important role in determining the use of adjuvant therapy The most promising risk factors are allelic loss of chromosome 18q (negative for prognosis) and MSI/MMR (positive for prognosis) MSI/‍MMR may be useful to identify a small (10–15%) subset of patients with stage II disease who are at very low risk of recurrence and in whom the benefits of chemotherapy are very unlikely Other potential predictive markers include 18q deletion, KRAS mutations, TP53, TGF-β receptor II (TGFBR2), deleted in colon cancer (DCC) and thymidylate synthase (TS) gene expression Currently, there is no evidence for a predictive marker for adjuvant chemotherapy for early CRC, and so the use of any predictive marker information for decision making is not recommended Generally, adjuvant treatment is recommended for patients with stage III or high-‍risk stage II disease. Patients with stage II disease are considered as high risk if they present with at least one of the following clinical characteristics: Lymph nodes sampling < 12 Poorly differentiated tumour Vascular or lymphatic or perineural invasion Tumour presentation with obstruction Tumour perforation pT4 stage An age of more than 70 years at presentation is not a contraindication to standard therapies, although available evidence suggests that these patients do not derive significant benefit from oxaliplatin-‍based combinations in the adjuvant setting Nomograms that consider all proven prognostic factors in order to quantify the risk of 5- and 10-year death have been developed and are available for CRC",

For right sided colon cancers, the benefit is less obvious since anastomosis must be hand sewn which requires a laparotomy The long-‍term oncological results of laparoscopic colectomy are similar to those of the conventional approach Advantages of laparoscopy over a conventional approach are reduced pain, reduced length of hospital stay, and reduced duration of ileus A laparoscopic approach should only be performed: By technically experienced surgeons When no serious abdominal adhesion due to prior major abdominal surgery is present When there is no locally advanced disease and/‍or acute bowel obstruction or perforation Obstructive colorectal cancers can be treated in one or two stages Two stage procedures can include colostomy first followed by colonic resection, or Hartmann’s procedure first followed by colostomy closure and anastomosis A one stage procedure involves either subtotal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis or, in selected cases, segmental resection after intra-‍operative colonic lavage Endoscopic stenting can be used to relieve obstruction from rectosigmoid cancer and allow subsequent one step resection Obstructive right sided cancers can be treated by colonic resection and immediate anastomosis",

A single elevated PSA level should not prompt a prostate biopsy and should be verified by a second value The decision whether or not to have a prostate biopsy should be made in the light of digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, ethnicity, age, comorbidities, PSA values, free/‍total PSA, history of previous biopsy and patient values Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-‍guided prostate biopsy should be performed under antibiotic cover and local anaesthesia. A minimum of 10–12 cores should be obtained Prior to repeat biopsy, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended with a view to MRI-‍guided or MRI-‍TRUS fusion biopsy Indications for repeat biopsies include a rising PSA, suspicious DRE, abnormal multi-‍parametric MRI, atypical small acinar proliferation or multifocal high-‍grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia The extent of involvement of each biopsy core and the most common and the worst Gleason grades should be reported Biopsy pathology should be reported using the International Society of Urologic Pathology recommendations",

As such, there is an increased trend for penile-‍preserving strategies, despite the fact that recurrence rates may be higher than those of radical surgical procedures Patient preference as well as compliance in attending follow-‍up visits after treatment must be considered in treatment decisions Surgical techniques can be grouped into three broad categories: For small volume and superficial penile lesions, circumcision, wide local excision and epithelial ablative techniques are mainstay treatments For glanular and distal penile tumours, it is now possible to preserve much more length, and cosmetic and functional results are far superior to conventional partial penectomy Improvements in preservation techniques: Ongoing studies are evaluating less resection for superficial tumours and more penile reconstruction (phalloplasty) for more advanced tumours suitable only for total penectomy The role of salvage surgery after radio/‍chemotherapy remains controversial For patients with extensive regional disease in which primary surgery is deemed unlikely to result in a clear margin, attempts at down-‍staging are appropriate.

    "text": "10.2.2.0 Example of a basic oral care protocol TWO KEY STRATEGIES FOR MITIGATION OF ORAL MUCOSAL INJURY BEFORE AND DURING TREATMENT ARE: Maintenance of optimal nutritional support throughout the entire period of cancer therapy. Developing a daily oral hygiene routine, including brushing teeth and the gums four times a day with a soft brush and using mouth rinses. This approach can contribute to the reduction and, ideally, prevention of oral tissue injury and associated pain, nutritional compromise, and related adverse outcomes. The following information is presented as a portfolio of patient-‍‍based instructions for which health professional guidance is recommended General measures Inspect your oral mucosa daily Have your dental team eliminate sources of trauma (e.g. ill-‍fitting prostheses; fractured teeth) Lubricate lips with (sterile) vaseline/‍‍white paraffin (petrolatum), lip balm, or lip cream. Be aware that vaseline/‍‍white paraffin (petrolatum) should not be used chronically on the lips, as this promotes mucosal cell dehydration and is occlusive leading to risk of secondary infection Drink ample amount of fluids to keep the mouth moist Brushing teeth and gums Use a soft toothbrush or swab (as tolerated) after meals and before sleep. Brushing with a soft toothbrush reduces risk of bleeding. Each month you should utilise a new soft toothbrush Clean the dentition and gingiva with a mild fluoride-‍‍containing, non-‍foaming toothpaste Brush teeth twice a day (after meals and at bedtime) according to the Bass or modified Bass method. If using an electric toothbrush, utilise the techniques cited in the product description instead Rinse the brush thoroughly after use with water and store the toothbrush in a cup with the brush head facing upward If you are used to do so, clean the area between the teeth once a day. Consult a dental hygienist/‍‍dentist about the most appropriate interdental cleaner (floss, toothpick, brushes). In case you are not used to use interdental cleaners on a regular basis, do not start with it while on cancer therapy, since it can break the epithelial barrier, visible through gingival bleeding Rinse mouth Rinse mouth with an alcohol-‍‍free mouthwash upon awakening and at least four times a day after brushing, for 1 min with 15 mL mouthwash; gargle; and then spit out. During the first half hour after rinsing, avoid eating and drinking Denture care Remove dentures before performing oral care. Brush dentures with toothpaste and rinse with water; clean the gums Defer wearing dental prostheses as much as possible until the lining tissues of your mouth are healed. If in the hospital, soak the denture for 10 min in an antimicrobial solution (e.g. chlorhexidine 0.2% if available) before inserting in your mouth",

If patients find the mouthwash painful, they should be advised to use one of these approaches beforehand Analgesics: Expert opinion suggests that, with moderate pain, a topical NSAID (e.g. amlexanox 5% oral paste) may be considered to treat moderate pain from stomatitis. When NSAIDs are not tolerated, consider acetaminophen (paracetamol) as maintenance therapy in combination with an immediate release oral opioid or fast-acting fentanyl preparation (e.g. 50 μg fentanyl nasal spray) to relief pain short term, for instance before dinner. Fast-acting fentanyl preparations are registered for patients who are already treated with opioids, they may also be considered in this population because of their short-‍‍term pain relief Analgesics: Expert opinion suggests that with persistent severe pain more aggressive pain management may be considered to treat severe pain from stomatitis. Since oral complaints can complicate administration of drugs by mouth, one should consider other kinds of administration routes, such as transdermal or intranasal routes Other treatments: Expert opinion suggests that other treatments, such as coating agents, topical analgesic or anti-‍inflammatory agents, topical anaesthetics, and alternative mouthwashes may be considered to treat stomatitis Steroids; topical: Expert opinion suggests that with ulcers topical high potency corticosteroids should be considered first: dexamethasone mouth rinse (0.1 mg/mL) in case several locations of the oral cavity is involved or difficult to reach ulcerations; clobetasol gel or ointment (0.05%) in case of limited locations and easy to approach ulcers to treat mIAS Steroid; intralesional injection: Expert opinion suggests that, with no ulcer resolution, intralesional steroid injection (triamcinolone weekly; total dose 28 mg) in conjunction with oral expert AND topical clobetasol gel or ointment (0.05%) should be considered to treat mIAS Steroids; systemic: Expert opinion suggests that for highly symptomatic ulcers and for recurrent ulcers or oesophageal lesions, systemic corticosteroids as initial therapy to bring symptom under control quickly (high-‍dose pulse 30–60 mg or 1 mg/kg) oral prednisone/‍‍ prednisolone for 1 week followed by dose tapering over the second week should be considered to treat mIAS   Suggestions in favour of an intervention: based on expert opinion. mIAS, mTOR inhibitor-associated mucositis; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; WHO, World Health Organization",
