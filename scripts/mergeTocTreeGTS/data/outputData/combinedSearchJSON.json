    "text": "Definition of myocardial infarction Criteria for acute myocardial infarction The term acute myocardial infarction (MI) should be used when there is evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with acute myocardial ischaemia. Under these conditions any one of the following criteria meets the diagnosis for MI: Detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values [preferably cardiac troponin (cTn)] with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) and with at least one of the following: Symptoms of ischaemia. New or presumed new significant ST-segment–T wave (ST–T) changes or new left bundle branch block (LBBB). Development of pathological Q waves in the ECG. Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality. Identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy. Cardiac death with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischaemia and presumed new ischaemic ECG changes, or new LBBB, but death occurred before cardiac biomarkers were obtained, or before cardiac biomarker values would be increased. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) related MI is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cTn values (>5 x 99th percentile URL) in patients with normal baseline values (≤99th percentile URL) or a rise of cTn values >20% if the baseline values are elevated and are stable or falling. In addition, either (i) symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischaemia or (ii) new ischaemic ECG changes or (iii) angiographic findings consistent with a procedural complication or (iv) imaging demonstration of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality are required. Stent thrombosis associated with MI when detected by coronary angiography or autopsy in the setting of myocardial ischaemia and with a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values with at least one value above the 99th percentile URL. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) related MI is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cardiac biomarker values (>10 x 99th percentile URL) in patients with normal baseline cTn values (≤99th percentile URL) In addition, either (i) new pathological Q waves or new LBBB, or (ii) angiographic documented new graft or new native coronary artery occlusion, or (iii) imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality. Criteria for prior myocardial infarction Any one of the following criteria meets the diagnosis for prior MI: Pathological Q waves with or without symptoms in the absence of non-ischaemic causes. Imaging evidence of a region of loss of viable myocardium that is thinned and fails to contract, in the absence of a non-ischaemic cause. Pathological findings of a prior MI.

The 2009 ESC Guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of IE introduced several innovative concepts, including limitation of antibiotic prophylaxis to highest risk patients, focus on healthcare-associated IE and identification of the optimal timing for surgery. However, the publication of new large series of IE studies, including the first randomized study regarding surgical therapy, the important improvement in imaging procedures, particularly in the field of nuclear imaging, and the discrepancies between the previous guidelines, justified the decision of the ESC to update the 2009 guidelines. In addition, the need for a collaborative approach, involving primary care physicians, cardiologists, surgeons, microbiologists, infectious disease specialists, and frequently other specialists, namely the ‘Endocarditis Team’, has been recently underlined, and is developed in these new guidelines.

They highlight the importance of hygiene measures, in particular oral and cutaneous hygiene. Epidemiological changes are marked by an increase in IE due to staphylococcus and of healthcare-associated IE, thereby highlighting the importance of non-specific aseptic measures. This should not concern only high-risk patients, but should also be part of routine care in all patients since IE occurring in patients without previously known heart disease now accounts for a substantial and increasing incidence. This means that, although prophylaxis should be restricted to high-risk patients, preventive measures should be maintained or extended to all patients with cardiac disease."

This multidisciplinary approach has already been shown to be useful in the management of valve disease (the ‘Heart Valve Clinic’), and has been shown to significantly reduce the 1-year mortality in infective endocarditis. Characteristics of the ‘Endocarditis Team’ When to refer a patient with IE to an ‘Endocarditis Team’ in a reference centre Patients with complicated IE, i.e. endocarditis with HF, abscess, or embolic or neurological complication or CHD, should be referred early and managed in a reference centre with immediate surgical facilities. Patients with non-complicated IE can be initially managed in a non-reference centre, but with regular communication with the reference centre, consultations with the multidisciplinary ‘Endocarditis Team’ and, when needed, with external visit to the reference centre. Characteristics of the reference centre Immediate access to diagnostic procedures should be possible, including TTE, TOE, multislice CT, MRI, and nuclear imaging. Immediate access to cardiac surgery should be possible during the early stage of the disease, particularly in case of complicated IE (HF, abscess, large vegetation, neurological, and embolic complications). Several specialists should be present on site (the ‘Endocarditis Team’), including at least cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, anaesthesiologists, ID specialists, microbiologists and, when available, specialists in valve diseases, CHD, pacemaker extraction, echocardiography and other cardiac imaging techniques, neurologists, and facilities for neurosurgery and interventional neuroradiology. Role of the ‘Endocarditis Team’ The ‘Endocarditis Team’ should have meetings on a regular basis in order to discuss cases, take surgical decisions, and define the type of follow-up. The ‘Endocarditis Team’ chooses the type, duration, and mode of follow-up of antibiotic therapy, according to a standardized protocol, following the current guidelines. The ‘Endocarditis Team’ should participate in national or international registries, publicly report the mortality and morbidity of their centre, and be involved in a quality improvement programme, as well as in a patient education programme. The follow-up should be organized on an outpatient visit basis at a frequency depending on the patient’s clinical status (ideally at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after hospital discharge, since the majority of events occur during this period). CHD =  congenital heart disease; CT = computed tomography; HF = heart failure; ID = infectious disease; IE = infective endocarditis; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; TOE = transoesophageal echocardiography; TTE = transthoracic echocardiography."

Three echocardiographic findings are considered major criteria for IE, including vegetation, abscess and new dehiscence of a prosthetic valve. However, the evaluation of patients with IE is no longer limited to conventional echocardiography, but should include other imaging techniques, such as multislice CT (MSCT), MRI, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT or other functional imaging modalities."

Drug treatment of PVE should last longer (at least 6 weeks) than that of native valve endocarditis (NVE) (2–6 weeks). In both NVE and PVE, the duration of treatment is based on the first day of effective antibiotic therapy, not on the day of surgery. A new full course of treatment should only start if valve cultures are positive, the choice of antibiotic being based on the susceptibility of the latest recovered bacterial isolate. The indications and pattern of use of aminoglycosides have changed. They are no longer recommended in staphylococcal NVE because their clinical benefits have not been demonstrated but they can increase renal toxicity; and, when they are indicated in other conditions, aminoglycosides should be given in a single daily dose in order to reduce nephrotoxicity. New antibiotic regimens have emerged in the treatment of staphylococcal IE, including Daptomycin and the combination of high-doses of cotrimoxazole plus clindamycin, but additional investigations are necessary in large series before they can be recommended in all patients."

Early consultation with a cardiac surgeon is recommended in order to determine the best therapeutic approach. Identification of patients requiring early surgery is frequently difficult and is an important scope of the ‘Endocarditis Team’. In some cases, surgery needs to be performed on an emergency basis (within 24 h), urgent basis (within a few days, <7 days), irrespective of the duration of antibiotic treatment. In other cases, surgery can be postponed to allow 1 or 2 weeks of antibiotic treatment under careful clinical and echocardiographic observation before an elective surgical procedure is performed. The three main indications for early surgery in IE are its 3 main complications, i.e. HF, uncontrolled infection, and prevention of embolic events."

    "text": "Neurological complications Symptomatic neurological events develop in 15–30% of all patients with IE and additional silent events are frequent. Stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic) is associated with excess mortality. Rapid diagnosis and initiation of appropriate antibiotics are of major importance to prevent a first or recurrent neurological complication. After a first neurological event, if cerebral haemorrhage has been excluded by cranial CT and neurological damage is not severe (i.e. coma), surgery indicated for HF, uncontrolled infection, abscess, or persistent high embolic risk should not be delayed and can be performed with a low neurological risk (3–6%) and good probability of complete neurological recovery. Conversely, in cases with intracranial haemorrhage, neurological prognosis is worse and surgery should generally be postponed for at least 1 month.

    "text": "Cardiac device-related IE CDRIE is one of the most difficult forms of IE to diagnose, and must be suspected in the presence of frequently misleading symptoms, particularly in elderly patients. Prognosis is poor, probably because of its frequent occurrence in elderly patients with associated comorbidities. In the majority of patients, CDRIE must be treated by prolonged antibiotic therapy and device removal. Cardiac device-related infective endocarditis: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention Recommendations Classa  Levelb  A. Diagnosis 1. Three or more sets of blood cultures are recommended before prompt initiation of antimicrobial therapy for CIED infection. I C 2. Lead-tip culture is indicated when the CIED is explanted. I C 3. TOE is recommended in patients with suspected CDRIE with positive or negative blood cultures, independent of the results of TTE, to evaluate lead-related endocarditis and heart valve infection. I C 4. Intracardiac echocardiography may be considered in patients with suspected CDRIE, positive blood cultures and negative TTE and TOE. IIb C 5. Radiolabelled leukocyte scintigraphy and 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning may be considered additive tools in patients with suspected CDRIE, positive blood cultures, and negative echocardiography. IIb C B. Principles of treatment 1. Prolonged (i.e. before and after extraction) antibiotic therapy and complete hardware (device and leads) removal are recommended in definite CDRIE, as well as in presumably isolated pocket infection. I C 2. Complete hardware removal should be considered on the basis of occult infection without other apparent source of infection. IIa C 3. In patients with NVE or PVE and an intracardiac device with no evidence of associated device infection, complete hardware extraction may be considered. IIb C C. Mode of device removal 1. Percutaneous extraction is recommended in most patients with CDRIE, even those with vegetations >10 mm. I B 2. Surgical extraction should be considered if percutaneous extraction is incomplete or impossible or when there is associated severe destructive tricuspid IE. IIa C 3. Surgical extraction may be considered in patients with large vegetations (>20 mm). IIb C D. Reimplantation 1. After device extraction, reassessment of the need for reimplantation is recommended. I C 2. When indicated, definite reimplantation should be postponed if possible to allow a few days or weeks of antibiotic therapy. IIa C 3. A “temporary” ipsilateral active fixation strategy may be considered in PM-dependent patients requiring appropriate antibiotic treatment before reimplantation. IIb C 4. Temporary pacing is not routinely recommended. III C E. Prophylaxis 1. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended before device implantation. I B 2.

The current definition of HF restricts itself to stages at which clinical symptoms are apparent. Before clinical symptoms become apparent, patients can present with asymptomatic structural or functional cardiac abnormalities [systolic or diastolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction], which are precursors of HF. Recognition of these precursors is important because they are related to poor outcomes, and starting treatment at the precursor stage may reduce mortality in patients with asymptomatic systolic LV dysfunction. Demonstration of an underlying cardiac cause is central to the diagnosis of HF. This is usually a myocardial abnormality causing systolic and/or diastolic ventricular dysfunction. However, abnormalities of the valves, pericardium, endocardium, heart rhythm and conduction can also cause HF (and more than one abnormality is of- ten present). Identification of the underlying cardiac problem is crucial for therapeutic reasons, as the precise pathology determines the specific treatment used (e.g. valve repair or replacement for valvular disease, specific pharmacological therapy for HF with reduced EF, reduction of heart rate in tachycardiomyopathy, etc)."

SCORE, which estimates the 10-year risk of a first fatal CVD, is recommended for risk assessment and can assist in making logical management decisions, and may help to avoid both under- and over-treatment. Other validated risk estimation systems are useful alternatives. Risk score systems should be used in apparently healthy people and not in individuals automatically at high to very high CV risk, e.g. because of established CV disease (see table Risk categories).

The target can be higher in frail elderly, or lower in most patients with diabetes and in some (very) high-risk patients without diabetes who can tolerate multiple blood pressure lowering drugs. bNon-HDL-C is a reasonable and practical alternative target because it does not require fasting. Non HDL-C secondary targets of <2.6, <3.4 and <3.8 mmol/L (<100, <130 and <145 mg/dL) are recommended for very high, high and low to moderate risk subjects, respectively. cA view was expressed that primary care physicians might prefer a single general LDL-C goal of 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL). While accepting the simplicity of this approach and that it could be useful in some settings, there is better scientific support for the three targets matched to level of risk. dThis is the general recommendation for those at very high-risk. It should be noted that the evidence for patients with chronic kidney disease is less strong."

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) should be determined before and periodically during cardiotoxic treatment for early detection of cardiac dysfunction. This group has decided to consider the lower limit of normal of LVEF in echocardiography as 50%, in line with the definition of cardiotoxicity commonly used in registries and trials in patients with cancer. A patient with a significant decrease in LVEF (e.g. a decrease >10%), to a value that does not drop below the lower limit of normal, should undergo repeated assessment of LVEF shortly after and during the duration of anticancer treatment. If LVEF decreases >10% to a value below the lower limit of normal (considered as an LVEF <50%), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)) in combination with beta-blockers are recommended to prevent further LV dysfunction or the development of symptomatic HF, unless contraindicated, as these patients are at high-risk of developing HF.

Assessment of CAD should be based on the history, age and gender of the patient, considering the use of chemotherapy drugs as a risk factor for CAD. Clinical evaluation and, when necessary, testing for detection of myocardial ischemia is key to identify patients with latent pre-existing CAD. This may have implications in the selection of cancer treatment. Patients treated with pyrimidine analogues should be closely monitored for myocardial ischaemia using regular ECGs, and chemotherapy should be withheld if myocardial ischaemia occurs. Drug rechallenge after coronary vasospasm should be reserved when no other alternatives exist, and only under prophylaxis and close monitoring of the patient. Pretreatment with nitrates and/or calcium channel blockers may be considered in this setting. Long-term clinical follow-up and, when required, testing for presence of coronary artery disease (CAD), may be useful to identify patients with cardiac disease who develop long-term complications of chemotherapy and radiotherapy."

Smoking There are no data that show an interaction between tobacco smoking and HCM, but patients should be provided with general advice on the health risks associated with smoking and, when available, information on smoking cessation. Sexual activity Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss their concerns about sexual activity. Anxiety and depression following a diagnosis are frequent and some patients may express guilt or fear about their genetic diagnosis and the risk of transmission to offspring. Patients should be counselled on the potential effect of their medication on sexual performance. In general, patients should avoid PDE5 inhibitors, particularly when they have LVOTO. Medication Patients should be provided with information about their medication, including potential side-effects and interactions with prescribed medications, over-the-counter remedies and other complementary therapies. Where possible, peripheral vasodilators should be avoided in patients, particularly when they have LVOTO. Vaccination In the absence of contra-indications, symptomatic patients should be advised to have yearly influenza vaccination. Driving Most patients should be eligible for an ordinary driving licence and can continue driving unless they experience distracting or disabling symptoms. Advice on driving licences for heavy goods or passenger-carrying vehicles should be in line with local legislation. For further advice on driving with ICD see EHRA guidancea and local rules. Occupation Most people with HCM will be able to continue in their normal job.

Out-of-office BP by home BP monitoring or, if available, ambulatory BP monitoring, is an important adjunct to conventional office BP measurement, mainly to exclude normal BP away from the medical environment (white-coat hypertension). The cut-off value for home BP (or daytime ambulatory BP) is 135/85 mmHg."

Initiation of antihypertensive treatment is guided by the risk category of the patient according to the stratification of total CV risk in low, moderate, high and very high risk, as outlined in the Figure: BP = blood pressure; CKD = chronic kidney disease; CVD = cardiovascular disease; DBP = diastolic BP; HT = hypertension; OD = organ damage; RF = risk factor; SBP = systolic BP. Risk factors include age, male sex, smoking, dyslipidaemia, glucose intolerance, obesity and family history of premature CVD. Asymptomatic organ damage mainly involves left ventricular hypertrophy, evidence of vascular damage and microalbuminuria. Recommendations on the initiation of antihypertensive treatment are as follows: High or very high risk: prompt initiation of antihypertensive drugs, together with lifestyle measures. Low or moderate risk: antihypertensive drugs should be considered if BP remains >140/90 mmHg after, respectively, several months or weeks of appropriate lifestyle measures, or in case of persistent elevated out−of− office BP after appropriate lifestyle measures. In elderly hypertensive patients antihypertensive drug treatment is recommended when systolic BP is ≥160 mmHg; drug treatment may also be considered in the elderly (at least when younger than 80 years and depending on the patient&#039;s risk category (see table above)) when systolic BP is in the 140−159 mmHg range, provided that antihypertensive treatment is well tolerated.

Individuals with high normal BP or white−coat hypertension, even in untreated, should be scheduled for regular follow−up, at least annually, to measure office and out−of−office BP, to check the CV risk profile and to reinforce recommendations on lifestyle changes. After initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy in patients with hypertension, the patient should be seen at 2− to 4−week intervals to evaluate the effects on BP and to assess possible side−effects. Once the target BP is reached, a visit interval of a few months is reasonable. Depending on the local organization of health care, later visits may be performed by non−physician health care workers, such as nurses. For stable patients, home BP monitoring and electronic communication with the physician may also provide an acceptable alternative. It is advisable to assess risk factors and asymptomatic organ damage at least every two years. The finding of an uncontrolled BP should always lead to a search for the cause(s), such as poor adherence, persistent white−coat effect or use of BP−raising substances. Appropriate actions should be taken for better BP control."

Since there is no defined heart rate below which treatment is indicated, correlation between symptoms and bradyarrhythmia is essential when deciding on the need for cardiac pacing therapy.

Cardiac dyssynchrony is complex and multifaceted. Prolongation of the AV interval delays systolic contraction, inter- and intra-ventricular conduction delays lead to asynchronous contraction of LV wall regions (ventricular dyssynchrony).

    "text": "3.0.0.0 Introduction The term “peripheral arterial diseases” (PADs) encompasses all arterial diseases other than coronary arteries and the aorta. This should be clearly distinguished from the term “peripheral artery disease” often used to name lower extremity artery disease (LEAD). Indeed, other peripheral localizations (Figure 1) are also frequently affected, mainly by atherosclerosis, and complete the family of PADs. Because of multiple presentations and therapeutic options, a multidisciplinary management of these patients is mostly necessary, and cardiologists should be sensitive in regard to the diagnosis and management of patients with PADs, as many of them are seen and managed for concomitant cardiac conditions. Major efforts are still necessary to sensitize healthcare providers, decision makers and the general population about the need for awareness, screening, prevention and management of the 40 million individuals in our continent affected by PADs. General recommendations on the management of patients with peripheral arterial diseases Recommendations Classa Levelb In healthcare centres, it is recommended to set up a multidisciplinary Vascular Team to make decisions for the management of patients with PADs. I C It is recommended to implement and support initiatives to improve medical and public awareness of PADs, especially cerebrovascular and lower extremity artery diseases.

Epidemiology and risk factors The risk of different localizations of PADs increases with age and with exposure to major CV risk factors: smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes. The strength of association between each risk factor and each vascular territory is variable. When a vascular territory is affected by atherosclerosis, not only is the corresponding organ endangered (e.g. the brain for carotid artery disease) but also the total risk of any cardiovascular event is increased (e.g. coronary events)."

Patients with clinical suspicion for LEAD: Lower extremities pulse abolition and/‍or arterial bruit Typical intermittent claudication or symptoms suggestive for LEAD Non-‍healing lower extremity wound Patients at risk for LEAD because of the following clinical conditions: Atherosclerotic diseases: CAD, any PADs Other conditions: AAA, CKD, heart failure Asymptomatic individuals clinically-free but at-‍risk for LEAD: Men and women aged >65 years Men and women aged <65 years classified at high CV risk according the ESC Guidelinesa Men and women aged >50 years with family history for LEAD 2. How to measure the ABI? In supine position, with cuff placed just above the ankle, avoiding wounded zones. After a 5–10 minute rest, the SBP is measured by a Doppler probe (5–10 MHz) on the posterior and the anterior tibial (or dorsal pedis) arteries of each foot and on the brachial artery of each arm. Automated BP cuffs are mostly not valid for ankle pressure and may display overestimated results in case of low ankle pressure. The ABI of each leg is calculated by dividing the highest ankle SBP by the highest arm SBP. 3. How to interpret the ABI? For diagnosis of LEAD interpret each leg separately (one ABI per leg). For the CV risk stratification: take the lowest ABI between the two legs. Interpretation: AAA = abdominal aorta aneurysm; ABI = ankle-‍brachial index; BP = blood pressure; CAD = coronary artery disease; CKD = chronic kidney disease; CV = cardiovascular; ESC = European Society of Cardiology; LEAD = lower extremity artery disease; PADs = peripheral arterial diseases; SBP = systolic blood pressure. aSubjects with: markedly elevated single risk factors; diabetes mellitus (except for young people with type 1 diabetes without other major risk factors); a calculated SCORE ≥5% and <10%.

    "text": "SCAD is generally characterized by episodes of reversible myocardial demand/supply mismatch related to ischaemia or hypoxia which are usually inducible by exercise, emotion or other stress and reproducible, but which may also be occurring spontaneously. Such episodes of ischaemia/hypoxia are commonly associated with transient chest discomfort (angina pectoris). SCAD also includes the stabilised, often asymptomatic, phases that follow an ACS. Finally, SCAD also comprises the long silent pre-symptomatic state of coronary arteriosclerosis. Angina at rest caused by coronary vasospasm is regarded within the scope of SCAD. The main features of SCAD are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Main features of SCAD Pathogenesis Stable anatomical atherosclerotic and/or functional alterations of epicardial vessels and/or microcirculation. Natural history Stable symptomatic or asymptomatic phases which may be interrupted by ACS. Mechanisms of myocardial ischaemia Fixed or dynamic stenoses of epicardial coronary arteries; Microvascular dysfunction; Focal or diffuse epicardial coronary spasm; The above mechanisms may overlap in the same patient and change over time. Clinical presentations Effort induced angina caused by: epicardial stenoses; microvascular dysfunction; vasoconstriction at the site of dynamic stenosis; combination of the above. Rest angina caused by: Vasospasm (focal or diffuse) epicardial focal; epicardial diffuse; microvascular; combination of the above. Asymptomatic: because of lack of ischaemia and/or of LV dysfunction; despite ischaemia and/or LV dysfunction. Ischaemic cardiomyopathy ACS = acute coronary syndrome; LV = left ventricular; SCAD = stable coronary artery disease. Whereas the various clinical presentations of SCAD are related to obstruction of the epicardial arteries caused by coronary plaques, to focal or diffuse spasm of normal or plaque-diseased arteries, microvascular dysfunction and/or ischaemia cardiomyopathy if present, stable coronary plaques with and without previous revascularization may also be completely clinically silent."

    "text": "The prognosis in patients with SCAD is relatively benign with estimates of annual mortality rates in mixed populations ranging from 1.2-2.4% with an annual incidence of cardiac death between 0.6 and 1.4%. In general, the outcome is worse in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and heart failure, a greater number of diseased vessels, more proximal locations of coronary stenoses, greater severity of lesions, more extensive ischaemia, more impaired functional capacity, older age, significant depression and more severe angina."

However, for the purpose of clarity the processes of obtaining diagnostic and prognostic information are dealt with separately in this text."

    "text": "In the majority in patients it is possible to make a confident diagnosis of the presence or absence of SCAD on the basis of history alone. However, physical examination and objective tests are often necessary to confirm the diagnosis, exclude alternative diagnoses and assess the severity of underlying disease. Definitions of typical and atypical angina pectoris are summarized in Table 2. Table 2 Traditional clinical classification of chest pain Typical angina (definite) Meets all three of the following characteristics: substernal chest discomfort of characteristic quality and duration; provoked by exertion or emotional stress; relieved by rest and/or nitrates within minutes. Atypical angina (probable) Meets two of these characteristics. Non-anginal chest pain Lacks or meets only one or none of the characteristics. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification which is widely used as a grading system for stable angina is shown in Table 3. Anginal pain at rest may occur in all grades of this classification as a manifestation of associated and superimposed coronary vasospasm. The class assigned is indicative of the maximum limitation while the patient may do better on other days. Table 3 Classification of angina severity according to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Class I Ordinary activity does not cause angina such as walking and climbing stairs. Angina with strenuous or rapid or prolonged exertion at work or recreation. Class II Slight limitation of ordinary activity. Angina on walking or climbing stairs rapidly, walking or stair climbing after meals, or in cold, wind or under emotional stress, or only during the first few hours after awakening. Walking more than two blocks on the level and climbing more than one flight of ordinary stairs at a normal pace and in normal conditions. Class III Marked limitation of ordinary physical activity. Angina on walking one to two blocksa on the level or one flight of stairs in normal conditions and at a normal pace. Class IV Inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort – angina syndrome may be present at rest. a Equivalent to 100–200 m."

Once the diagnosis of SCAD has been made, further management decisions largely depend on the severity of symptoms, the patient’s risk for adverse cardiac events and on patient preferences. Ideally, decisions about diagnostic and therapeutic management should be made together with the patient who needs comprehensible information about risks and benefits."

    "text": "1. Diagnosis Clinical probability is the basis of all diagnostic strategies for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) and should systematically be assessed either by clinical judgement or by a validated prediction rule. Plasma D-dimer measurement, preferably using a highly sensitive assay, is recommended in outpatients and in the emergency department to reduce the need for unnecessary imaging and irradiation. A normal computed tomographic (CT) angiography safely excludes PE in patients with low or intermediate clinical probability, or PE-unlikely, while CT angiography showing a segmental or more proximal thrombus confirms PE. A normal perfusion lung scan excludes PE, and a high probability ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan confirms PE; in case of a non-diagnostic V/Q lung scan, PE may be excluded if proximal compression venous ultrasonography (CUS) is negative and the clinical probability is low or PE-unlikely.   2. Prognostic assessment At the stage of clinical suspicion of PE, haemodynamically unstable patients with shock or hypotension should immediately be identified as high-risk patients. Normotensive patients in Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) Class ≥III or a simplified (s)PESI of ≥1 constitute an intermediate-risk group. Of these, patients who have both evidence of RV dysfunction (by echocardiography or CT angiography) and elevated cardiac biomarker levels in the circulation should be classified into an intermediate-high-risk category and monitored for early detection of haemodynamic decompensation. A PESI Class I or II, or a sPESI of 0, indicates a low risk of an early adverse outcome.   3. Acute phase treatment Primary reperfusion treatment, particularly systemic thrombolysis, is the treatment of choice for patients with high-risk PE. Unfractionated heparin with aPTT monitoring is the prefered anticoagulation regimen in such patients For most cases of acute PE without haemodynamic compromise, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux is the initial treatment of choice unless there is severe renal dysfunction. Systemic thrombolysis is not routinely recommended as primary treatment for patients with intermediate-high risk PE, but should be considered if clinical signs of haemodynamic decompensation appear; percutaneous catheter-directed treatment or surgical pulmonary embolectomy are alternative rescue procedures for intermediate-high-risk PE. The new oral anticoagulants (NOACs; direct inhibitors of factor Xa or thrombin) are non-inferior in terms of efficacy and possibly safer, particularly in terms of major bleeding, than the standard anticoagulation regimen consisting of heparin followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). Low-risk patients in the PESI Class I or II, and probably those with sPESI of 0, should be considered for early discharge and outpatient treatment, if this appears feasible based on the patient’s anticipated compliance as well as his/her family and social background.   4. Duration of anticoagulation For patients with unprovoked PE, oral anticoagulation is recommended for at least 3 months. In the extended treatment of VTE, NOACs are both effective (in terms of prevention of symptomatic or fatal VTE recurrence) and safe (particularly in terms of major bleeding), probably safer than standard VKA regimens. In patients who refuse to take or are unable to tolerate any form of oral anticoagulants, aspirin may be considered for extended secondary VTE prophylaxis.   5. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) Organized unresolved thrombi and pulmonary vascular remodelling contribute to progressive right ventricular failure and poor outcome in non-treated CTEPH. Life-long anticoagulation (with VKA and an INR of 2-3) is recommended for all patients with CTEPH. Pulmonary endarterectomy is the treatment of choice for the majority of patients. Pharmacotherapy and pulmonary angioplasty are emerging as treatment alternatives for non-operable patients as well as for those with pulmonary hypertension persisting after intervention.   6. PE in pregnancy Suspicion of PE in pregnancy warrants formal diagnostic assessment with validated methods. A negative D-dimer result has similar clinical significance as in non-pregnant patients. Perfusion lung scan may be considered to rule out suspected PE in pregnant women with a normal chest X-ray. A weight-adjusted dose of LMWH is the recommended therapy during pregnancy in patients without shock or hypotension. NOACs are contraindicated in pregnancy.   7. PE and cancer The risk of VTE in cancer patients is at least four times higher than in the general population and increases further with chemotherapy and surgical treatment. Incidental finding of pulmonary artery thrombi in cancer patients should be managed in the same way as symptomatic pulmonary embolism, particularly if found in segmental or more proximal arteries. For patients with PE and cancer, weight-adjusted subcutaneous LMWH should be considered for the first 3 to 6 months. Extended anticoagulation (beyond the first 3 to 6 months) should be considered for an indefinite period or until the cancer is considered cured."

    "text": "The diagnostic value and clinical significance of subsegmental defects on CT angiography are still debated. Patients with incidental (unsuspected PE) on CT angiography should probably be treated, especially if they have cancer and a proximal clot, but solid evidence in support of this recommendation is lacking. The benefits versus risks of “triple rule-out” CT angiography (to confirm or exclude coronary artery disease, pulmonary embolism and/or aortic dissection) need thorough evaluation - also considering increased radiation and contrast exposure - given the low prevalence of PE and aortic dissection in published series using that approach. Preliminary results suggest that reduced-dose intravenous thrombolysis may be safe and effective, particularly in intermediate-risk PE, but solid evidence is still lacking. Catheter-directed treatment (e.g. pharmacomechanical thrombolysis) has shown a promising efficacy and (particularly) safety profile, but data from larger study populations are needed to determine whether it will become a widely accepted (and widely available) alternative option to systemic thrombolysis for reperfusion treatment. The results of the phase III trials on the use of new oral anticoagulants in the treatment of PE and secondary prevention of VTE appear convincing; clinical experience with these drugs under ‘real world’ conditions is accumulating. Further management trials are necessary to crystallize the criteria that might permit early discharge and home treatment of low-risk patients with acute PE. The true risk for developing CTEPH after acute PE needs to be determined on the basis of high-quality data. There is lack of data to support the use of riociguat, or the off-label use of drugs approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension, as a therapeutic bridge to pulmonary endarterectomy in CTEPH patients considered to be at high risk due to poor haemodynamics. Advances in balloon pulmonary angioplasty are continuing in an attempt to make this technique a therapeutic alternative for selected patients with non-operable CTEPH. Data on the validity of clinical prediction rules for PE in pregnancy are lacking. The evidence supporting screening for occult cancer after unprovoked VTE is inconclusive. Further data are needed on the treatment of cancer patients with NOACs."

    "text": "Introduction Epidemiology Venous thromboembolism (VTE) encompasses deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). It is the third most frequent cardiovascular disease with an overall annual incidence of 100–200 per 100 000 inhabitants. Acute PE is the most serious clinical presentation of VTE and a major cause of mortality, morbidity, and hospitalization. As estimated on the basis of an epidemiological model, over 317 000 deaths were related to VTE in six countries of the European Union (with a total population of 454.4 million) in 2004. Of these cases, 34% presented with sudden fatal PE and 59% were deaths resulting from PE that remained undiagnosed during life; only 7% of the patients who died early were correctly diagnosed with PE before death. Since patients older than 40 years are at increased risk compared with younger patients, and the risk approximately doubles with each subsequent decade, an ever larger number of patients are expected to be diagnosed with (and perhaps die of) PE in the future."

VTE is considered ‘provoked’ in the presence of a temporary or reversible risk factor (such as surgery, trauma, immobilization, pregnancy, oral contraceptive use or hormone replacement therapy) within the last 6 weeks to 3 months before diagnosis, and ‘unprovoked’ in the absence thereof. PE may also occur in the absence of any known risk factor. The presence of persisting as opposed to major temporary risk factors may affect the decision regarding the duration of anticoagulation therapy after a first episode of PE.

    "text": "Diagnostic strategies Diagnostic algorithm for suspected PE with shock or hypotension Proposed diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected high-risk PE, i.e. presenting with shock or hypotension Suspected high-risk PE is an immediately life-threatening situation, and patients presenting with shock or hypotension present a distinct clinical problem. The clinical probability is usually high, and the differential diagnosis includes acute valvular dysfunction, tamponade, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and aortic dissection. The most useful initial test in this situation is bedside transthoracic echocardiography, which will yield evidence of acute pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction if acute PE is the cause of the patient’s haemodynamic decompensation. In a highly unstable patient, echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction is sufficient to prompt immediate reperfusion without further testing. Diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected high-risk PE CT = computed tomographic (pulmonary angiography); PE = pulmonary embolism; RV = right ventricle. a Includes the cases in which the patient’s condition is so critical that it only allows bedside diagnostic tests. b Apart from the diagnosis of RV dysfunction, bedside transthoracic echocardiography may, in some cases, directly confirm PE by visualizing mobile thrombi in the right heart chambers. Ancillary bedside imaging tests include transoesophageal echocardiography, which may detect emboli in the pulmonary artery and its main branches, and bilateral compression venous ultrasonography which may confirm deep vein thrombosis and thus be of help in emergency management decisions. c Thrombolysis; alternatively, surgical embolectomy or catheter-directed treatment.

    "text": "Diagnostic algorithm for suspected PE without shock or hypotension Proposed diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected PE in the absence of shock and hypotension Clinical probability assessment combined with plasma D-dimer measurement is the logical first step and allows PE to be ruled out in around 30% of patients, with a 3-month thromboembolic risk in patients left untreated of < 1%. D-dimer should not be measured in patients with a high clinical probability because of a low negative predictive value in this population. It is also less useful in hospitalized patients because the number needed to test to obtain a clinically relevant negative result is high. In most centres, multidetector computed tomographic (MDCT) angiography is the second-line test in patients with an elevated D-dimer level and the first-line test in patients with a high clinical probability. CT angiography is considered diagnostic of PE when it shows a clot at least at the segmen tal level of the pulmonary arterial tree. Diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected PE in the absence of shock and hypotension CT = computed tomographic; PE = pulmonary embolism. a Two alternative classification schemes may be used for clinical probability assessment, i.e. a three-level scheme (clinical probability defined as low, intermediate, or high) or a two-level scheme (PE unlikely or PE likely). When using a moderately sensitive assay, D-dimer measurement should be restricted to patients with low clinical probability or a PE-unlikely classification, while highly sensitive assays may also be used in patients with intermediate clinical probability of PE. Note that plasma D-dimer measurement is of limited use in suspected PE in hospitalized patients. b Treatment refers to anticoagulation treatment for PE. c CT angiogram is considered diagnostic of PE if it shows PE at the segmental or more proximal level. d In case of a negative CT angiogram in patients with high clinical probability, further investigation may be considered before withholding PE-specific treatment.

They are heterogeneous and have proven difficult to standardize. Still, echocardiographic assessment of the morphology and function of the RV may help in prognostic stratification. Echocardiographic criteria used to risk stratify patients with PE include RV dilatation, an increased RV/LV diameter ratio, hypokinesia of the free RV wall, increased velocity of the jet of tricuspid regurgitation, decreased tricuspid annulus plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), or combinations of the above. In addition to RV dysfunction, echocardiography can also identify right-to-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale and the presence of right heart thrombi, both of which are associated with increased mortality in patients with acute PE. Four-chamber views of the heart on CT angiography may detect RV enlargement (end-diastolic diameter, compared with that of the left ventricle) as an indicator of RV dysfunction."

    "text": "Lab tests, biomarkers and combined modalities RV pressure overload is associated with increased myocardial stretch, which leads to the release of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal (NT)-proBNP. The plasma levels of natriuretic peptides reflect the severity of RV dysfunction in acute PE. In normotensive patients with PE, the positive predictive value of elevated BNP or NT-proBNP concentrations for early mortality is low. On the other hand, low levels of BNP or NT-proBNP can identify patients with a favourable short-term clinical outcome based on their high negative predictive value. Transmural RV infarction despite patent coronary arteries has been found at autopsy of patients who died of massive PE. Elevated plasma troponin concentrations on admission have been reported in PE and were associated with worse prognosis. Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP), an early marker of myocardial injury, was also found to possess prognostic value in acute PE. Various combinations of clinical findings with imaging and laboratory tests have been proposed and tested in registries and cohort studies in an attempt to improve risk stratification of PE. The combination of RV dysfunction on the echocardiogram (or CT angiogram) with a positive cardiac troponin test was used as an inclusion criterion in a randomized thrombolysis trial which enrolled 1006 normotensive patients with acute PE. Patients treated with standard anticoagulation had a 5.6% incidence of death or haemodynamic decompensation within the first 7 days following randomization."

    "text": "Acute phase treatment Anticoagulation In patients with acute PE, anticoagulation is recommended with the objective to prevent both early death and recurrent symptomatic or fatal VTE. The standard duration of anticoagulation should cover at least 3 months. Within this period, acute-phase treatment consists of parenteral anticoagulation (unfractionated heparin, LMWH or fondaparinux) administration over the first 5–10 days. Parenteral heparin administration should overlap with the initiation of a vitamin K antagonist (VKA); alternatively, it can be followed by administration of one of the new oral anticoagulants dabigatran or edoxaban. If rivaroxaban or apixaban is given instead, oral treatment with one of these agents should be started directly or after a 1-2 day administration of unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux). In this latter case, acute-phase treatment consists of an increased dose of the oral anticoagulant over the first 3 weeks (for rivaroxaban), or over the first 7 days (for apixaban).

Although the exact prevalence and annual incidence of CTEPH is unknown, available data suggest that this condition may occur in approximately 5 individuals per million population per year. Planar V/Q lung scan remains the main first-line imaging modality for CTEPH, as it carries a 96–97% sensitivity and 90–95% specificity for the diagnosis. By contrast, in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH) and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, lung scans show either non-segmental perfusion defects or are normal. CT pulmonary angiography and right heart catheterization are necessary to detect organized thrombi and to confirm precapillary pulmonary hypertension, respectively. Pulmonary angiography should follow to characterize the type and distribution of intraluminal changes. Algorithm for the diagnosis of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension CT = computed tomography (pulmonary angiography and high resolution imaging of the lung for diagnosis of parenchymal lesions); CTEPH = chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; DSA = digital subtraction angiography; Echo = echocardiography; MRA = magnetic resonance angiography; TR = tricuspid regurgitation velocity; V/Q = ventilation-perfusion. a Conventional pulmonary angiography using DSA technique is the gold standard for imaging of the pulmonary vasculature.

    "text": "New Aspects The main changes and adaptations as compared with the previous ESC and ERS 2009 Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) Guidelines version are as follows: The table of contents structure has been simplified with three initial general chapters including classifications, basic aspects and differential diagnosis, two chapters for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and one chapter each for PH due to left heart disease (LHD), PH due to lung diseases and/or hypoxia, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), and PH due to unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms. New wordings and parameters for the haemodynamic definition of post- capillary PH sub-groups have been adopted. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) has been included in the haemodynamic definition of PAH. An updated common clinical classification, for adult and paediatric patients, is reported. New advances in pathology, pathobiology, genetics, epidemiology and risk factors are reported. An updated diagnostic algorithm has been provided in an independent chapter and novel screening strategies are proposed in the web addenda. The importance of expert referral centers in the management of PH patients has been highlighted in both the diagnostic and treatment algorithm. New developments on PAH severity evaluation and on treatments and treatment goals are reported, including combination therapy and two new drugs recently approved. The treatment algorithm has been updated accordingly. The chapters on PH due to LHD and lung diseases have been updated. The term “out of proportion PH” has been abandoned in both conditions. New diagnostic and treatment algorithms are reported in the CTEPH chapter, including general criteria for operability and for balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) and a new approved drug. A short chapter on PH due to unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms has been added."

    "text": "Definitions and classifications Definitions General definitions PH is defined as an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAPm) ≥25 mmHg at rest as assessed by right heart catheterization (RHC). Available data has shown that the normal mean PAPm at rest is 14 ± 3 mmHg with an upper limit of normal of approximately 20 mmHg. The clinical significance of PAPm between 21 and 24 mmHg is unclear. Patients presenting with PAP in this range should be carefully followed, when they are at risk for developing PAH (e.g. patients with connective tissue disease (CTD) or family members of patients with heritable PAH (HPAH)). Due to the lack of reliable data that defines which levels of exercise-induced changes in PAPm or PVR have prognostic implications, a disease entity ´PH on exercise´ cannot be defined and should not be used. A recent retrospective study has proposed a definition of PH on exercise with the combination of PAPm and total PVR data, but no outcome prospective validation has been provided. The term PAH describes a group of PH patients characterized haemodynamically by the presence of pre-capillary PH defined by pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) ≤15 mmHg and a PVR >3 Wood units (WU) in the absence of other causes of pre-capillary PH such as PH due to lung diseases, CTEPH, or other rare diseases. According to various combinations of PAP, PAWP, cardiac output (CO), diastolic pressure gradient (DPG) and PVR, assessed in stable clinical conditions, different haemodynamic definitions of PH are shown in Table 3 together with their corresponding clinical classification in Table 4."

    "text": "Classification of PAH associated with CHD A clinical classification of PAH associated with congenital heart disease is reported in Table 5 . Table 5 Clinical classification of pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease 1. Eisenmenger’s syndrome Includes all large intra- and extra-cardiac defects which begin as systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and progress with time to severe elevation of PVR and to reversal (pulmonary-to-systemic) or bidirectional shunting; cyanosis, secondary erythrocytosis, and multiple organ involvement are usually present. 2. PAH associated with prevalent systemic-to-pulmonary shunts Correctablea Non-correctable Includes moderate to large defects; PVR is mildly to moderately increased, systemic-to-pulmonary shunting is still prevalent, whereas cyanosis at rest is not a feature. 3. PAH with small/coincidentalb defects Marked elevation in PVR in the presence of small cardiac defects (usually ventricular septal defects <1 cm and atrial septal defects <2 cm of effective diameter assessed by echo), which themselves do not account for the development of elevated PVR; the clinical picture is very similar to idiopathic PAH. Closing the defects is contra-indicated. 4. PAH after defect correction Congenital heart disease is repaired, but PAH either persists immediately after correction or recurs/develops months or years after correction in the absence of significant postoperative haemodynamic lesions. PAH = pulmonary arterial hypertension; PVR = pulmonary vascular resistance. aWith surgery or intravascular percutaneous procedure. bThe size applies to adult patients. However, also in adults the simple diameter may be not sufficient for defining the haemodynamic relevance of the defect, and also the pressure gradient, the shunt size and direction, and the pulmonary to systemic flows ratio should be considered (Web Table II, available on the web at: www.escardio.org/guidelines)."

    "text": "PH diagnosis Clinical presentation The diagnosis of PH requires the clinical suspicion based on symptoms and physical examination and the review of a comprehensive set of investigations to confirm that haemodynamic criteria are met and to describe the aetiology and the functional and haemodynamic severity of the condition. The interpretation of these investigations requires, at the very least, expertise in cardiology, imaging and respiratory medicine and may best be discussed at a multidisciplinary team meeting. The symptoms of PH are non-specific and they include shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness, angina, dry cough and syncope. Symptoms at rest occur only in advanced cases. The presentation of PH may be modified by diseases which cause or are associated with PH as well as other concurrent diseases. The physical signs of PH include left parasternal lift, an accentuated pulmonary component of the second heart sound, an RV third heart sound, a pansystolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation, and a diastolic murmur of pulmonary regurgitation. Elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatomegaly, ascites, peripheral oedema, and cool extremities characterize patients with advanced disease. Clinical examination may be modified by the underlying cause of PH."

    "text": "Diagnostic investigations The list of investigations required for a comprehensive evaluation of patients with suspected PH are listed in Table 6. These investigations are selected according to the phase of the diagnostic process as shown in the Diagnostic Algorithm (Figure 1). Table 6 Diagnostic investigations utilised in patients with PHa Electrocardiogram Chest radiograph Echocardiography Pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gases Ventilation/perfusion lung scan High-resolution computed tomography, contrast enhanced computed tomography Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging Blood tests and immunology Abdominal ultrasound scan Right heart catheterization and vasoreactivity Pulmonary Angiography aThese investigations are selected according to the phase of the diagnostic process. The electrocardiogram (ECG) may provide supportive evidence of PH showing signs of right atrial enlargement or right ventricular hypertrophy, but a normal ECG does not exclude the diagnosis. The chest radiograph is abnormal in many patients with PH at the time of diagnosis. Findings may include central pulmonary arterial dilatation and ‘pruning’ (loss) of the peripheral blood vessels. Transthoracic echocardiography has a central role in the diagnostic process providing imaging on the effects of PH on the heart and estimate PAP from continuous wave Doppler measurements. Pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gases will identify the contribution of underlying airway or parenchymal lung disease. The ventilation/perfusion lung scan should be performed in patients with PH to look for CTEPH. High-resolution computed tomography and contrast enhanced computed tomography of the chest will contribute to the identification of patients with lung diseases and CTEPH respectively. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance imaging is accurate and reproducible in assessment of right ventricle size, morphology, and function. Blood tests, immunology and abdominal ultrasound scan are not useful in diagnosing PH, but are required to identify the aetiology of some forms of PH as well as end organ damage. Right heart catheterization (RHC) is required to confirm the diagnosis of PAH and CTEPH, to assess the severity of haemodynamic impairment, and to undertake vasoreactivity testing of the pulmonary circulation in selected patients. Recommendations for RHC are provided in Table 9. Recommendations for vasoreactivity testing are provided in Table 10."

The diagnostic process starts after the suspicion of PH and echocardiography compatible with PH (according to different levels of PH probability reported in Tables 7 and 8). In case of high or intermediate probability of PH, clinical history, symptoms, signs, ECG, chest radiograph, pulmonary function tests and high resolution CT of the chest are requested to identify the presence of Group 2 – LHD or Group 3 – lung diseases. If the diagnosis of left heart or lung diseases is confirmed, the appropriate treatment for these conditions should be considered. In presence of severe PH and/or RV dysfunction the patient should be referred to a PH expert center where additional causes of PH may be explored. In case of low probability of PH no additional investigation are required and other causes for symptoms should be considered together with follow-up. If the diagnosis of left heart or lung diseases is not confirmed a ventilation/ perfusion lung scan should be performed for the differential diagnosis between CTEPH and PAH. Concurrently, the patient should be referred to a PH expert center. If the ventilation/perfusion scan shows multiple segmental perfusion defects, a diagnosis of Group 4 – CTEPH should be suspected. The final diagnosis of CTEPH (and the assessment of suitability for PEA) will require CT pulmonary angiography, RHC and selective pulmonary angiography. PAH should be considered if a ventilation/perfusion scan is normal or shows only subsegmental “patchy” perfusion defects particularly in patients with associated conditions and/or risk factors for development of PAH such as family history, CTD, CHD, HIV infection, portal hypertension, or a history of drugs and toxins intake known to induce PAH. In Table 8 the further management according to the probability of PH is given including indications for RHC. Additional specific diagnostic tests including haematology, biochemistry, immunology, serology, ultrasonography and genetics will allow the final diagnosis to be refined.

    "text": "PAH Treatment algorithm A treatment algorithm for PAH patients is shown in Figure 2. The classes of recommendation and levels of evidence for the PAH treatments are shown in Tables 18 (monotherapy), 19 (initial combination therapy), 20 (sequential combination therapy) and 21 (intensive care treatment and interventions). Definition of clinical response to treatments is reported in Table 14. The PAH treatment algorithm does not apply to patients in other clinical groups, and in particular not to patients with PH associated with Group 2 – LHD or with Group 3 – lung diseases. In addition, the different treatments have been evaluated by RCTs mainly in IPAH, HPAH, PAH due to drugs, and in PAH associated with CTD or with CHD (surgically corrected or not). Treatment Algorithm Description (Figure 2). After the confirmation of the diagnosis of treatment naïve PAH patient in an expert center, the suggested initial approach is the adoption of the general measures and the initiation of the supportive therapy (Tables 15 and 16) if needed. Acute vasoreactivity testing should be performed only in patients with IPAH, HPAH, and PAH associated with drugs and toxins use. Vasoreactive patients should be treated with high doses (progressively titrated) of CCB; adequate response should be confirmed after 3–4 months of treatment (Table 17). Patients responders without an adequate clinical respose to CCB treatment should be treated with approved PAHmedications according with the non- vasoreactive patients treatment strategy. Non-responders to acute vasoreactivity testing who are at low or intermediate risk (Table 13) can be treated either with initial monotherapy (Table 18) or initial oral combination therapy (Table 19). If initial monotherapy is chosen, as head-to-head comparisons among different compounds are not available, no evidence-based first-line monotherapy can be proposed. In this case the choice of the drug may depend on a variety of factors including the approval status, the labelling, the route of administration, the side-effect profile, potential interaction with background therapies, patient preferences, comorbidities, physician experience, and the cost. As head-to-head comparison between initial combination therapy with ambrisentan plus tadalafil has proven to be superior to initial monotherapy with ambrisentan or tadalafil in delaying clinical failure, a higher grade of recommendation has been given to this initial combination (Table 19). In non-vasoreactive and treatment-naïve patients at high-risk (Table 13), initial combination therapy including intravenous prostacyclin analogues should be considered (Table 19). Intravenous epoprostenol should be prioritised as it has reduced the 3 months rate of mortality in high-risk PAH patients also as monotherapy (Table 18). Alternative types of initial combination therapy may be considered (Table 19). In case of inadequate clinical response to initial combination therapy or initial monotherapy (Table 14), sequential double or triple combination therapy is recommended according with Table 20. The combination of riociguat and PDE 5i is contra-indicated. In case of inadequate clinical response with sequential double combination therapy (Table 14), triple combination therapy should be attempted (Tables 19 and 20). It seems reasonable to consider eligibility for lung transplantation after an inadequate clinical response to the initial monotherapy or initial combination therapy, and to refer the patient for lung transplantation soon after the inadequate clinical response is confirmed on maximal combination therapy (Table 21). BAS should be regarded as a palliative or bridging procedure in patients deteriorating despite maximal medical therapy. Figure 2 Treatment algorithm for pulmonary arterial hypertension CCB = calcium channel blockers; DPAH = drug induced PAH; HPAH = heritable PAH; IPAH: = idiopathic PAH; i.v. = intravenous; PAH = pulmonary arterial hypertension; PCA = prostacyclin analogues. aSome WHO-FC III patients may be considered high-risk (see Table 13). bInitial combination with ambrisentan plus tadalafil has proven to be superior to initial monotherapy with ambrisentan or tadalafil in delaying clinical failure. cIntravenous epoprostenol should be prioritised as it has reduced the 3 months rate for mortality in high-risk PAH patients also as monotherapy. dConsider also balloon atrial septostomy.

    "text": "1. Diagnosis Clinical probability is the basis of all diagnostic strategies for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) and should systematically be assessed either by clinical judgement or by a validated prediction rule. Plasma D-dimer measurement, preferably using a highly sensitive assay, is recommended in outpatients and in the emergency department to reduce the need for unnecessary imaging and irradiation. A normal computed tomographic (CT) angiography safely excludes PE in patients with low or intermediate clinical probability, or PE-unlikely, while CT angiography showing a segmental or more proximal thrombus confirms PE. A normal perfusion lung scan excludes PE, and a high probability ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan confirms PE; in case of a non-diagnostic V/Q lung scan, PE may be excluded if proximal compression venous ultrasonography (CUS) is negative and the clinical probability is low or PE-unlikely.   2. Prognostic assessment At the stage of clinical suspicion of PE, haemodynamically unstable patients with shock or hypotension should immediately be identified as high-risk patients. Normotensive patients in Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) Class ≥III or a simplified (s)PESI of ≥1 constitute an intermediate-risk group. Of these, patients who have both evidence of RV dysfunction (by echocardiography or CT angiography) and elevated cardiac biomarker levels in the circulation should be classified into an intermediate-high-risk category and monitored for early detection of haemodynamic decompensation. A PESI Class I or II, or a sPESI of 0, indicates a low risk of an early adverse outcome.   3. Acute phase treatment Primary reperfusion treatment, particularly systemic thrombolysis, is the treatment of choice for patients with high-risk PE. Unfractionated heparin with aPTT monitoring is the prefered anticoagulation regimen in such patients For most cases of acute PE without haemodynamic compromise, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux is the initial treatment of choice unless there is severe renal dysfunction. Systemic thrombolysis is not routinely recommended as primary treatment for patients with intermediate-high risk PE, but should be considered if clinical signs of haemodynamic decompensation appear; percutaneous catheter-directed treatment or surgical pulmonary embolectomy are alternative rescue procedures for intermediate-high-risk PE. The new oral anticoagulants (NOACs; direct inhibitors of factor Xa or thrombin) are non-inferior in terms of efficacy and possibly safer, particularly in terms of major bleeding, than the standard anticoagulation regimen consisting of heparin followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). Low-risk patients in the PESI Class I or II, and probably those with sPESI of 0, should be considered for early discharge and outpatient treatment, if this appears feasible based on the patient’s anticipated compliance as well as his/her family and social background.   4. Duration of anticoagulation For patients with unprovoked PE, oral anticoagulation is recommended for at least 3 months. In the extended treatment of VTE, NOACs are both effective (in terms of prevention of symptomatic or fatal VTE recurrence) and safe (particularly in terms of major bleeding), probably safer than standard VKA regimens. In patients who refuse to take or are unable to tolerate any form of oral anticoagulants, aspirin may be considered for extended secondary VTE prophylaxis.   5. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) Organized unresolved thrombi and pulmonary vascular remodelling contribute to progressive right ventricular failure and poor outcome in non-treated CTEPH. Life-long anticoagulation (with VKA and an INR of 2-3) is recommended for all patients with CTEPH. Pulmonary endarterectomy is the treatment of choice for the majority of patients. Pharmacotherapy and pulmonary angioplasty are emerging as treatment alternatives for non-operable patients as well as for those with pulmonary hypertension persisting after intervention.   6. PE in pregnancy Suspicion of PE in pregnancy warrants formal diagnostic assessment with validated methods. A negative D-dimer result has similar clinical significance as in non-pregnant patients. Perfusion lung scan may be considered to rule out suspected PE in pregnant women with a normal chest X-ray. A weight-adjusted dose of LMWH is the recommended therapy during pregnancy in patients without shock or hypotension. NOACs are contraindicated in pregnancy.   7. PE and cancer The risk of VTE in cancer patients is at least four times higher than in the general population and increases further with chemotherapy and surgical treatment. Incidental finding of pulmonary artery thrombi in cancer patients should be managed in the same way as symptomatic pulmonary embolism, particularly if found in segmental or more proximal arteries. For patients with PE and cancer, weight-adjusted subcutaneous LMWH should be considered for the first 3 to 6 months. Extended anticoagulation (beyond the first 3 to 6 months) should be considered for an indefinite period or until the cancer is considered cured."

    "text": "The diagnostic value and clinical significance of subsegmental defects on CT angiography are still debated. Patients with incidental (unsuspected PE) on CT angiography should probably be treated, especially if they have cancer and a proximal clot, but solid evidence in support of this recommendation is lacking. The benefits versus risks of “triple rule-out” CT angiography (to confirm or exclude coronary artery disease, pulmonary embolism and/or aortic dissection) need thorough evaluation - also considering increased radiation and contrast exposure - given the low prevalence of PE and aortic dissection in published series using that approach. Preliminary results suggest that reduced-dose intravenous thrombolysis may be safe and effective, particularly in intermediate-risk PE, but solid evidence is still lacking. Catheter-directed treatment (e.g. pharmacomechanical thrombolysis) has shown a promising efficacy and (particularly) safety profile, but data from larger study populations are needed to determine whether it will become a widely accepted (and widely available) alternative option to systemic thrombolysis for reperfusion treatment. The results of the phase III trials on the use of new oral anticoagulants in the treatment of PE and secondary prevention of VTE appear convincing; clinical experience with these drugs under ‘real world’ conditions is accumulating. Further management trials are necessary to crystallize the criteria that might permit early discharge and home treatment of low-risk patients with acute PE. The true risk for developing CTEPH after acute PE needs to be determined on the basis of high-quality data. There is lack of data to support the use of riociguat, or the off-label use of drugs approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension, as a therapeutic bridge to pulmonary endarterectomy in CTEPH patients considered to be at high risk due to poor haemodynamics. Advances in balloon pulmonary angioplasty are continuing in an attempt to make this technique a therapeutic alternative for selected patients with non-operable CTEPH. Data on the validity of clinical prediction rules for PE in pregnancy are lacking. The evidence supporting screening for occult cancer after unprovoked VTE is inconclusive. Further data are needed on the treatment of cancer patients with NOACs."

    "text": "1. The holistic view to the aorta as “whole organ” The guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of aortic diseases highlight the value of a holistic approach, viewing the aorta as the whole organ; indeed, in many cases tandem lesions of the aorta may exist, as illustrated by the increased probability of thoracic aortic aneurysm in the case of abdominal aortic aneurysm, making a distinction between the two regions inadequate. In addition thorako-abdominal aortic diseases are overwriting this separation.   2. Diagnostic Imaging Whereas a clinical examination and laboratory testing play a minor role in the diagnosis and treatment of aortic diseases, imaging techniques, particularly modern images techniques, play a major role yielding a view of the total aorta, which requires standardized reports and measurements at given landmarks.   Comparison of methods for imaging the aorta   Advantages/​disadvantages TTE TOE CTc MRIc Aortography Ease of use +++ ++ +++ ++ + Diagnostic reliability + +++ +++ +++ ++ Bedside/​interventional usea ++ ++ – – ++ Serial examinations ++ + ++(+)b +++ – Aortic wall visualizationc + +++ +++ +++ – Cost – – – – – – – – – – Radiation 0 0 – – – – – – Nephrotoxicity 0 0 – – – – – – – –   CT = computed tomography; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; TOE = transoesophageal echocardiography; TTE = transthoracic echocardiography. + means a positive aspect and – means a negative point.

It is recommended to measure diameters at anatomical landmarks perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. In case of repetitive imaging of the aorta the imaging should be used, with the lowest iatrogenic risk. In addition, it is recommended to use the same imaging modality with the similar method of measurement. All relevant parameters are recommended to be reported recording to the aortic segmentation. It is recommended to assess renal function, pregnancy and history of allergy to contrast agents in order to select the optimal imaging modality with minimal radiation exposure. Complete list of normal values for all discussed imaging techniques are found in the Full Text and Web Addenda.   3. The acute aortic syndrome Acute aortic syndromes (AAS) are defined as emergency conditions with similar clinical characteristics involving the aorta: aortic dissection, intramural haematoma, penetrating aortic ulcer, complete rupture of the aorta, traumatic aortic injury, iatrogenic aortic dissection. A flowchart for the emergency room has been developed in order to enhance the standardization of decision making in acute aortic syndromes, because survival is strongly related to time. In the diagnostic work-up clinical data are useful to assess the priori probability of AAS including the high-risk patient conditions, high-risk pain features and signs of high-risk examination features.     High-risk conditions Marfan syndrome (or other connective tissue diseases) Family history of aortic disease Known aortic valve disease Known thoracic aortic aneurysm Previous aortic manipulation (including cardiac surgery) High-risk pain features Chest, back, or abdominal pain described as any of the following: abrupt onset severe intensity ripping or tearing High-risk examination features Evidence of perfusion deficit: pulse deficit systolic blood pressure difference focal neurological deficit (in conjunction with pain) Aortic diastolic murmur (new and with pain) Hypotension or shock Risk score varies from 0–3 according the number of positive categories (1 point per column). Table modified from Rogers AM et al Circulation 2011;123:2213-8.   Based on the probability of acute aortic syndromes the decision making can be based according to developed flow-chart.   Flowchart for decision-making based on pretest sensitivity of AAS AAS = acute aortic syndrome; AD = aortic dissection; ESC = European Society of Cardiology; CT = computed tomography; ECG = electrocardiogram; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; STEMI = ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; TTE = transthoracic echocardiography; TOE = transoesophageal echocardiography. aSTEMI can be associated with AAS in rare cases. - bPending local availability, patient characteristics, and physician experience. cProof of Type A AD by the presence of flap, aortic regurgitation, and/or pericardial effusion. - dPreferably point-of-care, otherwise classical. eAlso troponin to detect non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.   4. Treatment of acute aortic syndrome 4.1 Medical management A lot of patients with aortic diseases have comorbidities such as coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and others. Therefore treatment and prevention strategies have to be similar to those indicated for the above diseases. Specific treatments in different aortic diseases are addressed in each specific chapter.   4.2 (Thoracic) endovascular aortic repair ((T)EVAR) It is recommended to decide the indication of endovascular repair on individual basis according to anatomy, pathology, comorbidity and anticipated durability, of any repair using multidisciplinary approach (Class I C). A sufficient proximal and distal landing zone of at least 2 cm is recommended for the safe deployment and durable fixation of TEVAR (Class I C). In case of aortic aneurysm it is recommended to select a stent-graft with a diameter exceeding the diameter of the landing zones by at least 10-15% of the reference aorta (Class I C). During stent graft placement, invasive blood pressure monitoring and control either pharmacologically or by rapid pacing is recommended (Class I C). For complicated type B aortic dissection, TEVAR is recommended (Class I C). If the anatomy is suitable and the expertise available endovascular repair should be preferred over open surgery in contained rupture of thoracic aortic aneurysm (Class I C). For uncomplicated type B aortic dissection endovascular therapy should be considered (Class IIa B) as well as in complicated type B intramural haematoma, complicated type B penetrating aortic ulcer and traumatic aortic injury (Class IIa C)   4.3 Surgery in acute aortic syndrome In patient with type A aortic dissection urgent surgery is recommended (Class I B). Surgery is also indicated in typ A intramural haematoma (Class I C). In case of type B penetrating aortic ulcer, surgery should be considered (Class IIa C). For complicated type B aortic dissection, intramural haematoma and penetrating aortic ulcer surgery may be considered (Class IIb C).   5. Aortic aneuryms When an aortic aneurysm is identified at any location, assessment of the entire aorta and aortic valve is recommended at baseline and during follow-up (Class I C). In case of aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, duplex ultrasound for screening of peripheral artery disease and peripheral aneurysms should be considered (Class IIa C). Patients with aortic aneurysms are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, general principles of cardiovascular prevention should be considered (Class IIa C).   5.1 Indication for intervention for ascending and arch aortic aneuryms Surgery is indicated in patients who have aortic root aneurysms with maximal aortic diameter ≥50 mm for patients with Marfan syndrome (Class I C). Surgery should be considered in patients who have aortic root aneurysm with maximal ascending aortic diameter: ≥45 mm for patients with Marfan syndromes with risk factors (family history of aortic dissection and/or aortic diameter increase >3 mm/year ≥50 mm for patients with bicuspid valve with risk factors ≥55 mm for patients with no elastopathy (Class IIa C). Surgery should be considered in patients who have isolated aortic arch aneurysm with maximal diameter ≥55 mm (Class IIa C). Lower levels thresholds for intervention may be considered according to body surface area in patients of small stature or in case of rapid progression, aortic valve regurgitation, planned pregnancy, and patients preference (Class IIb C). Aortic arch repair may be considered in patient with aortic arch aneurysm who already have an indication for surgery of an adjacent aneurysm located in the ascending aorta or descending aorta (Class IIb C).   5.2 Intervention for descending aortic aneurysms Valvular problems associated with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) are covered in the 2012 ESC/EACTS guidelines on management of valvular diseases (European Heart J 2012;33:2451-2496).   6. Abdominal aortic aneurysm Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) have a prevalence of about 2% and are particularly found in men >65 years and women who are smoking >65 years. Aortic AAA are usually asymptomatic until rupture occurs. The aortic diameter relates to risks of rupture. As a screening tool ultrasound is recommended in all men >65 years (Class I A) and considered in women >65 years and tobacco smoking (Class IIb C). Very new is the advice, to use a 2 minutes extra time during TTE to check for existence of an asymptomatic AAA in men >65 years (Class IIa B) and women >65 years who are smoking (Class IIb C). Target screening should be considered in first degree siblings of AAA patients (Class IIa B). Please check 2014 ESC/ESA Guidelines on non-cardiac surgery for cardiovascular risk assessment and management (European Heart J 2014:35:2383-2431). Additional information concerning reduction of cardiac risk in case of intervention and surgery are given.   6.1 Endovascular aortic repair and open vascular surgery About 60% of all AAA are suitable for endovascular therapy. In randomized controlled studies endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) reduced mortality threshold. But long-term result were similar due to high re-intervention rates. Smoking cessation is recommended to slow the AAA growth (Class I B). AAA repair is indicated if AAA diameter exceeds 55 mm (Class I B). If the anatomy is suitable for EVAR, either open or endovascular aortic repair is recommended (Class I A). If the aneurysm is anatomically not suitable for EVAR, open endovascular aortic surgery is recommended (Class I C). 6.2 Management of symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms In case of rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms two randomized controlled trials are available demonstrating similar 30 days mortality results (30.4% versus 37.4%). Based on these results following recommendations are given. In suspected ruptured AAA, immediate abdominal ultrasound is recommended (Class I C). In case of rupture, AAA emergency repair is indicated (Class I C). In case of symptomatic but non rupture AAA, urgent repair is indicated (Class I C). In case of symptomatic AAA anatomical suitable for EVAR, either open or endovascular repair is recommended (Class I A).   7. Long-term follow-up for chronic aortic dissection Contrast CT or MRI is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of chronic aortic dissection (Class I C). Close imaging surveillance in aortic dissection is indicated to detect signs of complications (Class I C). In patients with chronic aortic dissection, tight blood pressure control (> 130/80 mmHg) is indicated (Class I C). After TEVAR or EVAR surveillance is recommended after 1 month, 6 months, 12 months and then yearly (Class I C). CT is recommended as the first choice imaging technique for follow-up after TEVAR or EVAR (Class I C). In AAA Doppler ultrasound with or without contrast agents should be considered for annual postoperative surveillance, with non-contrast CT imaging over 5 years (Class IIa C). For follow-up in young patients MRI should be preferred to CT for imaging magnetic resonance-compatible stent grafts (Class IIa C).   8. Genetic diseases affording the aorta Chromosomal and inherited syndromic thoracic aneurysms During the last years more insight into chromosomal aortic diseases have been given not only for the Marfan syndrome, but also for the Loeys-Dietz syndrome, the Turner syndrome, the Ehlers Danlos syndrome Typ IV, non syndromic familiar aortic aneurysms and even aneurysms – osteoarthritis syndrome and arterial tortuosity syndrome. It is recommended to investigate first degree relatives (siblings and parents) of a subject with thoracic aortic disease to indentify a familiar form in which relatives all have a 50% chance of carrying the familiar mutation-disease (Class I C). Once a familial form of thoracic acute aortic dissection (TAAD) is highly suspected, it is recommended to refer the patient to geneticist for family investigation and molecular testing (Class I C). Variable of age of oncet warrants screening every 5 years of “healthy” at-risk relatives until diagnosis (clinical or molecular) is established or ruled out (Class I C). In familial non syndromic TAAD, screening for aneurysm should be considered not only in the thoracic aorta, but also throughout the arterial tree (including cerebral arteries) (Class IIa C).   8.1 Medical therapy in genetic diseases • In Marfan syndrome beta-blockers are prescribed to reduce the progression rate. • Angiotensin 2 receptor blockers demonstrated attenuation of the dilatation rate of aortic aneurysms. • In Ehlers-Danlos syndrome beta-blockers reduce arterial complications. • No specific data are available for other genetic diseases.   9. Management of bicuspid aortic valve BAV have a prevalence of about 1%. Fusion of the right and left coronary cusp or fusion of the right and none coronary cusp or found combined with normal size aorta, supra-coronary dilatation or cylindric aortic shape. The maximal aortic dilatation rate does not differ for bicuspid aortic valve and Marfan syndrome and is maximal in the tubular aorta (0.42 ± 0.6 and 0.49 ± 0.5 mm/year). BAV have a high heritability with about one quarter with bicuspid aortic valve found in the first degree relatives. The aortic root dilatation is found in about one third in first degree relatives. In case of BAV, surgery is indicated when the aortic root or thoracic aorta diameter is >55 mm, >50 mm in presence of other risk factors, >45 mm when surgical aortic valve replacement is scheduled (Class I C). Because of the familial occurence screening of first degree relatives should be considered (Class IIa C).   10. Future developments The installation of hybrid rooms have been shown to be pacemakers for the development of new diagnostic and treatment options like thoracic endovascular aortic repair, debranching or aortic arch surgery, and the frozen elephant trunk. This can lead in the future to further paradigma changes in the diagnosis and treatment of aortic diseases. It is time to form aortic teams and centers in order to provide full access to experts in the field of cardiology, radiology, pediatric cardiology, genetics, aortic and cardiovascular surgery, which is needed not only for the acute but also for the intense follow-up of patients with aortic diseases."

    "text": "The 2014 ESC Guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of aortic diseases contains in 118 recommendations 4% Class I A recommendations, and in 15% Class I-II B recommendations. Thus, 80% are consensus decision. We need more epidemiological data on acute aortic syndrome in Europe. More evidence needed on the caseload-outcome relationship in the field aortic diseases. The implantation and efficacy of aortic centers in Europe should be assessed. The establishment of a European network of aortic centers should be encouraged along with establishment of large registries and multicenter studies. The value of biomarkers should be clarified. More data of accuracy and reproducibility of aortic measurements are needed. The knowledge on relationship between aortic size and outcome should be improved and the superiority of 3D on 2D better documented. It has to been investigated, if there are difference of aortic diameters related to age, gender and body-size taken into account outcome of interventions. Data for female patients with aortic diseases are lacking. The lack of evidence on the efficacy of medical therapy and the role of antihypertensive drugs, statins, inflammatory drugs an non-syndromic aortic diseases like aortic dissection, thoracic aortic aneurysms and AAA, genetic diseases is present. For thoracic aortic aneurysms, randomized studies are needed and the optimal timing for preventive intervention according to lesion size and other characteristics as well as individual patient features. The optimal timing and techniques of intervention in chronic aortic dissection is still unclear."

    "text": "1. Definition Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is defined by the presence of increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness that is not solely explained by abnormal loading conditions. In an adult, this represents a wall thickness ≥15 mm in one or more LV myocardial segments (or ≥13 mm in a first degree relative of someone with HCM) measured by any imaging technique.   2. Prevalence & Aetiology Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) occurs in 0.02–0.23%of adults, with much lower rates in patients diagnosed under the age of 25 years. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be caused by many genetic and non-genetic disorders. In up to 60% of patients with HCM, the disease is an autosomal dominant trait caused by mutations in cardiac sarcomere protein genes. 5-10% of adult cases are caused by other genetic disorders including inherited metabolic and neuromuscular diseases, chromosome abnormalities and genetic syndromes.   3. Genetic Counselling & Testing Genetic counselling is recommended in all patients with unequivocal HCM when it cannot be explained solely by a non-genetic cause. When a definite causative genetic mutation is identified in a patient, his or her first degree relatives should first be genetically tested. They should undergo clinical evaluation if they are found to carry the same mutation.   4. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction Two-thirds of patients with HCM have dynamic obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOTO) at rest or during exercise caused by contact between the mitral valve and the interventricular septum during systole. In patients with a resting LVOT gradient <50 mmHg bedside physiological provocation with Valsalva manoeuvre and standing should be routinely performed during echocardiography to determine if LV outflow obstruction can be provoked. Exercise stress echocardiography is recommended in symptomatic patients with an LVOT gradient <50 mmHg at rest or during physiological provocation. When a gradient is detected in the LV cavity, the presence of sub-aortic membranes, structural mitral valve leaflet abnormalities and mid-cavity obstruction should be systematically excluded.   5. Assessment of symptoms Most people with HCM are asymptomatic and have a normal life expectancy but somedevelop symptoms, often many years after the first manifestation of ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities. Systematic 2-D and Doppler echcardiography, exercise testing and ambulatory ECG monitoring are usually sufficient to determine the most likely cause of symptoms.   6. Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death While the risk of sudden death is low for most patients with HCM, a small number are prone to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. The use of a new risk calculator (HCMRisk-SCD) (http://doc2do.com/hcm/webHCM.html) is recommended to guide the use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD). In all patients, clinical efficacy of ICD implantation should be balanced against its potential risk.   7. Symptomatic treatment In symptomatic patients with LVOTO, the aim is to reduce dyspnoea and chest pain by using drugs, surgical myectomy, alcohol ablation or pacing. Therapy in symptomatic patients without LVOTO focuses on management of arrhythmias, reduction of LV filling pressures, and treatment of angina. Patients with symptomatic progressive LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction refractory to medical therapy may be candidates for cardiac transplantation.   8. Atrial Arrhythmias Patients with HCM and paroxysmal, persistent or permanent AF should receive treatment with vitamin K antagonists. Lifelong therapy with oral anticoagulants is recommended, even when sinus rhythm is restored. Patients in sinus rhythm with LA diameter ≥45 mm should undergo 6–12 monthly 48-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring to detect AF.   9. Management of Pregnancy Most women with HCM tolerate pregnancy well but require expert advice and monitoring throughout pregnancy. All women with HCM should receive advice on contraception, sterilisation and termination when appropriate.   10. Multidisciplinary Care Clinicians should consider referral of patients to multidisciplinary teams with expertise in the diagnosis, genetics, risk stratification and management of myocardial disease."

    "text": "1. Score and risk stratification Risk models have a role to play in the assessment of patients undergoing revascularisation; however they should only be used as a guide, and not as a replacement for sound clinical judgment and multidisciplinary dialogue. Proper implementation of the Guidelines’ recommendations in specific clinical situations will often require calculation of GRACE or SYNTAX scores, or EuroSCORE, as relevant.   2. Process for decision making and patient information Revascularisation strategy should be based on best evidence and discussed within a Heart Team, either on a case by case basis or through approved protocols. The patient should have access to all relevant information on short and long-term outcomes. In elective situations, consent of properly informed patients should not be obtained under time pressure.   3. Strategies for pre-intervention diagnosis and imaging It is strongly recommended that elective invasive procedures and revascularisation for lesions without functional significance be deferred until the diagnosis of ischaemia, using functional testing, has been documented. Patients with a substantial amount of dysfunctional but viable myocardium are likely to benefit from myocardial revascularisation. Imaging tests for myocardial viability are helpful in selecting patients with ischaemic heart failure who should or should not undergo revascularisation.   4. Revascularisation for stable coronary artery disease For more severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (SYNTAX scores > 22 for 3-vessel disease and SYNTAX scores > 32 for left main disease), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) offers a survival advantage as well as a reduced need for repeat intervention at two years. While recommendations for coronary intervention by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or CABG should be mainly evidence-based, the overall clinical picture (e.g. advanced age, significant co-morbidities, need for dual antiplatelet medication) as well as patient preferences should also be considered.   5. Revascularisation in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome Patients with high risk for progressive myocardial damage and those with ongoing symptoms and anterior ST depression with suspected posterior thrombotic occlusion should undergo angiography without delay. Patients at high risk (GRACE score > 140 or multiple other high-risk criteria) should be planned for angiography as soon as possible and not delayed beyond one day. Patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) at lower risk and those with recurrent symptoms or inducible ischaemia at stress test should be scheduled for angiography and subsequent revascularisation during hospital stay.   6. Revascularisation in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) Organization of a network ensuring prompt pre-hospital diagnosis, rapid transfer to a 24/7 primary PCI-capable centre and short door-to-balloon time are the most effective methods to reduce mortality and improve long-term outcome. Patients who cannot receive primary PCI within the recommended intervals of 90-120 minutes after first medical contact should be promptly treated with fibrinolysis and transferred to a PCI centre, immediately, if there are doubts on the effectiveness of the pharmacological reperfusion (rescue PCI), within 24 hours in all other cases (elective urgent angiography).   7. Diabetes In stable diabetic patients with extensive CAD, revascularisation is indicated in order to improve major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MACCE)-free survival. In diabetic patients, CABG, rather than PCI, should be considered when the extent of the CAD justifies a surgical approach and the patient’s risk profile is acceptable. When PCI is performed, use of drug-eluting stent (DES) is recommended in order to reduce restenosis and repeat target vessel revascularisation.   8. Myocardial revascularisation in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) Surgical myocardial revascularisation should be preferred in patients with mild or moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) and multivessel disease, in particular if diabetes is the cause of the CKD. Percutaneous revascularisation may be preferred in more fragile patients with severe CKD and several co-morbidities. All patients with CKD undergoing angiography or myocardial revascularisation should receive preventive hydration with isotonic saline to be started at least 12 h before angiography and continued at least 24 h afterwards, in order to reduce the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. The amount of contrast media should be as low as possible and not exceed 4 mL/kg.   9. Myocardial revascularisation in patients requiring valve surgery Surgery remains the standard of care for patients with valve disease and concomitant coronary artery disease; however in those deemed too high risk for surgery, alternative options may include hybrid valve/PCI procedures or trans-catheter aortic valve replacement.   10. Associated carotid/peripheral vascular disease Carotid revascularisation is justified in patients scheduled for CABG with prior history of stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and high grade carotid stenosis especially if symptoms are recent. In patients undergoing CABG who present unilateral asymptomatic carotid artery disease, there is little evidence demonstrating superiority of prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) over optimal medical treatment. CEA and CAS are complementary methods that should be performed only by teams that can demonstrate a 30-day death/stroke rate < 3% for neurologically asymptomatic patients and < 6% for patients with previous neurological symptoms. Selection between CEA and CAS should be based on patient profile assessment made by a multidisciplinary team.   11. Myocardial revascularisation in chronic heart failure Myocardial revascularisation should be always performed in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and systolic (LV) dysfunction, presenting predominantly with anginal symptoms and regardless of ventricular volumes. In patients with CHF presenting predominantly with HF symptoms and no or mild angina, myocardial revascularisation should be performed only in the presence of viability and left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) ≤ 60 mL/m2. Conversely, myocardial revascularisation should not be performed in the absence of viability, regardless of volumes. CABG combined with surgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR) may be consideredin selected patients with a scar in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery territory and LVESVI ≥ 60 mL/m2.   12. Arrhythmias in patients with ischaemic heart disease Atrial fibrillation (AF), before or after CABG, is associated with increased mortality. Beta-blockers are recommended to decrease the incidence of AF after CABG.   13. Procedural aspects In CABG, arterial grafting to the LAD system is indicated and is also preferred if possible to non-LAD vessels in patients with reasonable life expectancy. During CABG, minimization of aortic manipulation is recommended. Fractional-flow reserve (FFR)-guide PCI is recommended for detection of ischaemia-related lesion(s) when objective evidence of vessel-related ischaemia is not available. DES are recommended for reduction of restenosis/re-occlusion, if no contra-indication to extended DAPT. Distal embolic protection is recommended during PCI of saphenous vein graft disease to avoid distal embolization of debris and prevent myocardial infarction.   14. Secondary prevention Myocardial revascularisation is one component of CAD management, and must be accompanied by adequate secondary prevention strategies. Optimal medical therapy (OMT), risk factors modification and permanent lifestyle changes should be prescribed because they reduce future morbidity and mortality, in a cost-effective way. Secondary prevention strategies should be initiated during hospitalisation when patients are highly motivated. The interventional cardiologist and cardiac surgeon should stress its importance: failure to do this may lead to the patient’s perception that it is less valuable than the revascularisation procedure itself.   15. Strategies for follow-up Follow-up strategies should focus on secondary prevention, as well as on the assessment of patients’ functional status and symptoms. Stress ECG should be preferably combined with functional imaging due to low sensitivity and specificity of stress ECG alone in revascularised patients. Early stress imaging is indicated even in asymptomatic patients such as with primary PCI or emergency CABG for ST-segment elevation infarction (STEMI), resuscitated from sudden death, patients with incomplete or suboptimal revascularisation and others who may have security jobs/competitive sports and those with high risk for atherosclerosis progression."

    "text": "Are the results of PCI and CABG from randomised trials and registries applicable to an ever increasingly elderly population? Whereas the results of CABG in patients with multi-vessel and left main coronary artery disease are well documented over several decades of follow-up, it is not yet known how durable the early promising results of PCI will be in the same patients over the longer term. There is so far no evidence to support the impact of structured informed consent or of a heart team. Randomised trial to compare outcomes related to adherence with guidelines is lacking. The best single risk model to use in patients requiring revascularisation is yet to be established. The optimal revascularisation strategy for subgroups of NSTEMI patients, such as women, elderly, patients with impaired renal function, and patients with high bleeding risk, needs to be assessed further. The optimal pharmacological treatment combination before an invasive investigation and during percutaneous coronary intervention is not defined. Few randomised clinical trials have assessed health outcomes for diagnostic tests and the available evidence has been largely derived from non-randomised studies. For patients with CKD the role of off-pump surgical technique needs further confirmation and the role of DES in CKD patients needs further assessment."

    "text": "The document outlines an innovative classification of bradyarrhythmias by mechanism. There are three main groups: persistent bradycardia, intermittent bradycardia with electrocardiographic documentation, and suspected intermittent bradycardia (not yet documented). Recommendations are provided for the three categories. Until now, guidelines and text books have classified bradyarrhythmias according to their aetiology, for example sinus node dysfunction, myocardial infarction, or bundle branch block. Classification of bradyarrhythmias according to mechanism (i.e., the clinical presentation) is more useful for selecting patients for permanent cardiac pacing therapy than their aetiology. The strength of indications for CRT focuses mainly on the presence or absence of left bundle branch block. Unique recommendations are given for NYHA class II and III patients. A spectrum of response to CRT, as with most other treatments, is recognized: the beneficial effects of CRT may be greater in females, patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy and patients with QRS duration >150 ms (the longer the QRS duration, the greater the benefit). Different recommendations are given for an upgrade or “de novo“ implantation of CRT in patients with a brady indication for pacing. Clinical guidance to the choice between CRT-P or CRT-D in primary prevention is provided. In the decision process for indication for pacing/CRT and for the choice of the best modality attention should be paid to a careful evaluation of the risk of complications. In general the risk of complications is higher when implanting more complex devices and for re-intervention and upgrades."

    "text": "1 - Total cardiovascular risk stratification Decisions on management of the hypertensive patient depend on the initial level of total cardiovascular (CV) risk. The stratification of total CV risk in different categories is based on BP category, CV risk factors, asymptomatic organ damage and presence of diabetes, symptomatic CV disease or chronic kidney disease. The classification in low, moderate, high and very risk refers to the 10-year risk of CV mortality as defined in the 2012 Joint CVD Prevention Guidelines. Figure 1 Stratification of total CV risk in categories of low, moderate, high and very high risk according to SBP and DBP and prevalence of RFs, asymptomatic OD, diabetes, CKD stage or symptomatic CVD. Subjects with a high normal office but a raised out-of-office BP (masked hypertension) have a CV risk in the hypertension range. Subjects with a high office BP but normal out-of-office BP (white-coat hypertension), particularly if there is no diabetes, OD, CVD or CKD, have lower risk than sustained hypertension for the same office BP. BP = blood pressure; CV = cardiovascular; CVD = cardiovascular disease; CKD = chronic kidney disease; DBP = diastolic blood pressure; HT = hypertension; OD = organ damage; RF = risk factor; SBP = systolic blood pressure. Risk factors include age, male sex, smoking, dyslipidaemia, glucose intolerance, obesity and family history of premature CVD. Asymptomatic organ damage mainly involves left ventricular hypertrophy, evidence of vascular damage and microalbuminuria.   2 - Diagnostic evaluation The initial evaluation of a patient with hypertension should: 1) confirm the diagnosis of hypertension; 2) detect causes of secondary hypertension; and 3) assess CV risk, organ damage, and concomitant clinical conditions. This calls for BP measurement, medical history including family history, physical examination, laboratory investigations, and further diagnostic tests. Some of the investigations are needed in all patients, others only in specific patient groups.   2a. Blood pressure measurement Office blood pressure Conventional office BP measurement by use of a validated device is the gold standard for screening, diagnosis and management of hypertension. Hypertension is defined as systolic BP ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg. The diagnosis of hypertension should be based on at least two BP measurements in the sitting position per visit on at least two visits.   Out-of-office BP Out-of-office BP, assessed by ambulatory or home BP monitoring, is an important adjunct to office BP measurement. The prediction of CV events is significantly better with out-of-office BP than with office BP. Prognosis is better in white-coat hypertension than in sustained hypertension and appears to be similar to that in true normotension. The incidence of CV events is about two times higher in masked hypertension than in true normotension and similar to the incidence in sustained hypertension. Cut-offs for the definition of hypertension are: 130/80 mmHg for 24-h BP, 135/85 mmHg for daytime ambulatory BP and home BP and 120/70 mmHg for night-time BP. Major indications for out-of-office BP are suspicion of white-coat, masked or nocturnal hypertension, suspected hypotension, considerable variability of office BP and treatment-resistant hypertension.   2b. Cardiovascular risk factors Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and fasting triglycerides and glucose are considered routine tests in all hypertensive patients.   2c. Search for asymptomatic organ damage and symptomatic disease Heart: an ECG is recommended in all hypertensive patients; additional tests (echocardiography, exercise testing, Holter monitoring) should be considered based on history, physical examination and ECG findings. Arteries: carotid and peripheral ultrasound, pulse wave velocity and ankle-brachial index should be considered as additional tests if indicated. Kidney: measurement of serum creatinine and estimation of glomerular filtration rate, assessment of urinary protein and microalbuminuria are recommended in all hypertensive patients.   2d. Search for secondary hypertension. All patients should undergo simple screening tests for secondary hypertension, including clinical history, physical examination and laboratory investigations, and a focused search should be undertaken when indicated.   3 - Treatment approach 3a. Lifestyle changes Appropriate lifestyle changes are the cornerstone for the prevention of hypertension and are also important for its treatment. The following lifestyle measures are recommended: Salt restriction to 5-6 g/day. Moderation of alcohol consumption (<20-30 g of ethanol per day in men and <10-20 g in women). Increased consumption of vegetables, fruits and low-fat dairy products. Reduction of weight to BMI of 25 kg/m2. Regular exercise (≥30 min of moderate dynamic exercise on 5-7 days per week) Smoking cessation   3b. Initiation of antihypertensive drug treatment. Prompt initiation of antihypertensive drugs is recommended in patients at high or very high CV risk. Antihypertensive drugs should be considered in patients at moderate or low risk when BP remains >140/90 mmHg after, respectively, several weeks or months of appropriate lifestyle measures, or in case of persistently elevated out-of-office BP. In elderly patients drug treatment is recommended when systolic BP is ≥160 mmHg, or ≥140 mmHg if younger than 80 years and treatment is well tolerated. It is not recommended to initiate antihypertensive treatment at high normal BP and in younger patients with isolated systolic hypertension.   3c. Blood pressure goals Systolic BP A systolic BP goal of <140 mmHg is recommended in all hypertensive patients, with few exceptions. In elderly hypertensive patients less than 80 years old there is solid evidence to reduce systolic BP to between 150 and 140 mmHg, but a goal of <140 mmHg may be considered in fit elderly.In individuals older than 80 years it is recommended to reduce BP to between 150 and 140 mmHg if they are in good physical and mental condition.   Diastolic BP A diastolic BP of <90 mmHg is always recommended, except in patients with diabetes, in whom values <85 mmHg are recommended.   3d. Choice of antihypertensive drugs Diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are all suitable for the initiation and maintenance of antihypertensive treatment, either as monotherapy or in combination therapy. Some agents should be considered as the preferential choice in specific conditions, such as coronary heart disease, heart failure, diabetes or renal dysfunction. Initiation of antihypertensive therapy with two-drug combination may be considered in patients with markedly high baseline BP of at high CV risk. Among the many possible combinations, some are considered more suitable than others.   4 - Treatment strategies in special conditions 4a. White-coat and masked hypertension In white-coat hypertensives without additional risk factors, therapeutic intervention is limited to lifestyle changes and close follow-up is warranted. In case of higher CV risk, antihypertensive drug treatment may be considered. In masked hypertension, both lifestyle measures and drug treatment should be considered because of the high CV risk.   4b. Elderly When antihypertensive therapy is indicated as described in section 3b, all antihypertensive agents canbe used, although diuretics and calcium antagonists may be preferred in isolated systolichypertension.   4c. Pregnancy Drug treatment is recommended in severe hypertension in pregnancy (BP >160/110 mmHg), and may be considered in case of persistent BP ≥150/95 mmHg, and in those with BP ≥140/90 mmHg in the presence of gestational hypertension, asymptomatic organ damage or symptoms. Methyldopa, labetalol and nifedipine should be considered preferential antihypertensive drugs in pregnancy. Blockers of the renin-angiotensin system should be avoided in women withchild-bearing potential.   4d. Diabetes It is recommended to start drug treatment when systolic BP is ≥140 mmHg. The BP targetis <140/85 mmHg. All classes of antihypertensive drugs can be used, though blockers of therenin-angiotensin system may be preferred, especially in the presence of proteinuria or microalbuminuria, but simultaneous administration of two blockers of the renin-angiotensin system should be avoided.   4e. Nephropathy It is recommended to start drug treatment when systolic BP is ≥140 mmHg, targeting <140 mmHg. A target of <130 mmHg may be considered in case of overt proteinuria, and blockers of therenin- angiotensin system (though not in combination) are indicated in the presence of proteinuria or microalbuminuria.   4f. Cerebrovascular disease It is not recommended to intervene with BP-lowering therapy during the first week after acute stroke, although clinical judgement should be used in the face of very high systolic BP values. Antihypertensive treatment is recommended in hypertensive patients with a history of stroke or TIA when systolic BP is ≥140 mmHg, targeting <140 mmHg. All drug regimens are recommendedin these patients, provided that BP is effectively reduced.   4g. Heart disease Coronary heart disease It is recommended to start drug treatment when systolic BP is ≥140 mmHg, and all antihypertensive agents can be used, targeting <140 mmHg. Beta-blockers are recommended in case of recent myocardial infarction, and beta-blockers and calcium antagonists in patients with angina pectoris. Heart failure Diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are recommended in patients with heart failure or severe left ventricular dysfunction. There is no evidence that antihypertensive therapy per se or any particular drug is beneficial in case of preserved ejection fraction. Lowering of systolic BP to around 140 mmHg should be considered in all of these patients. Left ventricular hypertrophy Antihypertensive therapy is recommended, and initiation with one of the agents that have shown greater ability to regress left ventricular hypertrophy should be considered, i.e. ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and calcium antagonists.   4h. Resistant hypertension In case of true treatment-resistant hypertension, addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, amiloride, and/or the alpha-blocker doxazocin should be considered. In case of ineffectiveness of drug treatment invasive procedures such as renal denervation and baroreceptor stimulation may be considered.   5 - Treatment of associated risk factors It is recommended to use statin therapy in hypertensive patients at moderate to high CV risk, targeting an LDL cholesterol value <3.0 mmol/L (115 mg/dL). When overt CHD is present,it is recommended to administer statin therapy to achieve LDL cholesterol levels <1.8 mmol/L(70 mg/dL). Antiplatelet therapy, in particular low-dose aspirin, is recommended in hypertensive patients with previous CV events. Aspirin should also be considered in hypertensive patients with reduced renal function or at high CV risk, provided that BP is well controlled. Aspirin is not recommended for CV prevention in low-moderate risk hypertensive patients, in whom absolute benefit and harm are equivalent. In hypertensive patients with diabetes, a HbA1c target of <7.0% is recommended with antidiabetic treatment. In more fragile elderly patients with a longer diabetes duration, more comorbidities and at high risk, treatment to a HbA1c target of <7.5–8.0% should be considered.   6 - Follow-up and improvement of blood pressure control Individuals with high normal BP or white-coat hypertension, even in untreated, should be scheduled for regular follow-up, at least annually, to measure office and out-of-office BP, to check the CV risk profile and to reinforce recommendations on lifestyle changes. After initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy in patients with hypertension, the patient should be seen at 2- to 4-week intervals to evaluate the effects on BP and to assess possible side-effects. Once the target BP is reached, a visit interval of a few months is reasonable. Depending on the local organization of health resources, many of the later visits may be performed by non-physician health care workers, such as nurses. For stable patients, home BP monitoring and electronic communication with the physician may also provide an acceptable alternative. It is advisable to assess risk factors and asymptomatic organ damage at least every 2 years. The finding of an uncontrolled BP should always lead to a search for the cause(s), such as poor adherence, persistent white-coat effect or use of BP-raising substances. Appropriate actions should be taken for better BP control, avoiding physician inertia."

Should elderly patients with a SBP between 140 and 160 mmHg be given antihypertensive drug treatments? Should drug treatment be given to subjects with white-coat hypertension? Can this condition be differentiated into patients needing or not needing treatment? Should antihypertensive drug treatment be started in the high normal BP range and, if so, in which patients?

    "text": "1 - Diabetes mellitus is A metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion or action, or a combination of both. ≈ 95% comprised by T2DM. An important contributor to vascular damage inducing a high risk of macro-and microvascular complications.   2 - Identification Screening for T2DM can be implemented using a non-invasive risk score (e.g. FINDRISC) supplemented by the assessment of glycaemia in people at high risk. Diagnosis of DM can be made by the measurement of FPG (>7.0 mmol/L), 2hPG (>11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c (>6.5%). HbA1c <6.5% does not exclude a diagnosis of diabetes which should be further investigated by OGTT in people at high risk of disturbed glucose metabolism. Abnormal PG or HbA1c test results should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis.   3 - Prevention Progression of IGT to DM can be delayed by lifestyle intervention in about 50% of individuals. The intervention effect is sustained after lifestyle counselling has ceased. Pharmacotherapies (a-glucosidase inhibitors, metformin, glitazones, insulin, ARBs) can delay progression to DM in people with IGT whilst the drug is taken.   4 - Assessment of individual cardiovascular risk Classical risk factors (family history, lifestyle, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia). Glycaemic status. Macrovascular disease (coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral artery disease, heart failure). Microvascular disease (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy). Arrhythmias especially atrial fibrillation.   5 - Multifactorial management of cardiovascular risk Patient education and empowerment. Life style advice. Smoking cessation. Personalised treatment of blood pressure, lipids, glucose and thrombotic risk.   6 - Life style intervention Daily consumption of vegetable and fruits. Increased dietary fibre intake. Moderate intake of simple carbohydrates. Reduced total dietary fat intake. Replacement of saturated fat by monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fat. Physical activity >30 min/day or at least 150 min/week. Weight reduction >5% if BMI >25 kg/m2. Moderate alcohol consumption.   7 - Key targets* for prevention of cardiovascular disease BP <140/85 mmHg. LDL cholesterol <1.8 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL). HbA1c <7% (<53 mmol/mol). *These targets should be applied with individual needs taken into account.   8 - Multifactorial medical management A combination of blood pressure lowering agents is often required to achieve control and RAAS blockade should be part of the treatment. Lipid control is based on statins. Antiplatelet therapy is recommended for secondary prevention of CVD. A combination of glucose lowering agents is often required to achieve glycaemic control and metformin should be considered as first line treatment especially in overweight/obese patients.   9 - Options for revascularisation Acute coronary syndromes Early angiography and culprit lesion revascularization should be offered. Stable coronary artery disease CABG is preferred if the myocardial area at risk is large (multi-vessel disease, complex coronary lesions). PCI with DES may be performed for symptom control in single- and two-vessel disease. Peripheral artery disease Critical limb ischaemia and symptomatic carotid artery disease should be revascularised.   10 - Heart failure T2DM is a major risk factor for the development of heart failure. The combination of DM and heart failure has a 12-fold higher mortality than DM alone. Pharmacological management include combinations of RAAS inhibitors, beta blockade and diuretic therapy. Non-pharmacological approaches should be considered as in patients without DM .   11 - Multidisciplinary strategies Comprehensive care of DM patients often requires collaboration between specialists in cardiology, diabetology and primary care and several other subspecialties such as surgery ophthalmology, nephrology and psychiatry. Nurses, dieticians, podiatrists and physiotherapists and care professionals are important collaborators."

    "text": "There is a need for biomarkers and diagnostic strategies useful for the early detection of CAD in asymptomatic patients. Long-term CVD outcomes for most glucose-lowering treatments are not known. Optimal blood pressure targets are unknown. Are the metabolic side effects of beta-blockers or diuretics clinically relevant? Efficiency and safety of drugs increasing/improving HDL-C particles is unclear. The optimal antithrombotic regimen for primary prevention of CVD needs to be established. Pleiotropic effects of glucose lowering therapies on CVD outcomes is not fully understood. The role and level of glycaemic control in the outcome in ACS patients remain to be established. The role and level of glycaemic control in the outcome during and after myocardial revascularization remain to be established. The impact of glucose-lowering drugs including metformin, GLP-1 analogues and DPP-IV inhibitors on the prevention of heart failure is unknown. What is the role of hypoglycaemia and other predictors in sudden cardiac death?"

    "text": "1. General aspects Counseling of women with known or suspected CVD should start before pregnancy and include genetic aspects. Women with high risk - according the WHO scores - should be managed in specialized centres, by interdisciplinary teams. Foetal congenital malformations in affected families should be searched by echocardiography starting week 13. For CVD diagnosis in the mother, prefer echocardiography, exercise testing and magnetic resonance imaging (without contrast material); avoid radiation. Cardiac catheter and surgical interventions in the mother should be avoided, but are possible. Mode of delivery should be individualized. Vaginal delivery is preferred in most patients.   2. Congenital Heart Disease Most women with congenital heart disease tolerate pregnancy well. The risk depends on the underlying heart disease and its complexity, in particular on ventricular and valvular function, functional class and cyanosis. All patients should be seen by the end of the first trimester and an individualized follow up plan should be established. Vaginal delivery can be planned in most patients. Pregnancy is contraindicated in patients with pulmonary hypertension or Eisenmenger syndrome due to high risk of maternal mortality. Cyanosis poses a significant risk to the fetus, with a live birth unlikely (<12%) if maternal oxygen saturation is <85%. An irreversible decline in systemic ventricular function is seen in 10% of patients with TGA corrected with Mustard / Senning repair. Although successful pregnancy is possible in selected patients after Fontan operation, these are moderate to high risk pregnancies.   3. Aortic Disease Pregnancy is a high risk period for all patients with aortic pathology. Dissection occurs most often in the last trimester of pregnancy (50%) or the early postpartum period (33%). The diagnosis of aortic dissection should be considered in all patients with chest pain during pregnancy. In women with Marfan syndrome and aortic root diameters >45 mm pregnancy should be discouraged. Approximately 50% of the patients with a bicuspid aortic valve and aortic stenosis have dilatation of the ascending aorta. Dissection does occur, although less frequently than in Marfan patients. Caesarean delivery should be considered when the aortic diameter exceeds 45 mm.   4. Valvular heart disease Moderate and severe mitral stenosis are poorly tolerated during pregnancy and should be treated interventionally pre-pregnancy. During pregnancy percutaneous commissurotomy should only be considered when symptoms persist despite medical therapy. In aortic stenosis intervention pre-pregnancy is indicated in case of symptoms, LV dysfunction or symptoms during exercise testing. Regurgitant lesions are better tolerated than stenotic lesions. Pre-pregnancy intervention is only indicated when severe regurgitation is accompanied by refractory heart failure or severe ventricular dilatation or dysfunction. Mechanical valve prosthesis: Oral anticoagulation (OAC) with vitamin K antagonists is the safest therapy to prevent valve thrombosis and is therapy of choice during the second and third trimester. During the first trimester continuation of OAC should be considered when the required daily dose is low (warfarin <5 mg). Pregnant patients on higher warfarin dose should be considered for unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with strict dose-adjustment according to aPPT or anti-factor Xa levels (weekly control). At the 36th week of gestation OAC should be discontinued and replaced by dose-adjusted unfractionated heparin or LMWH. When delivery starts while still on OAC, caesarean delivery is indicated to prevent fetal cerebral bleeding.   5. Coronary artery disease Primary PCI (with bare metal stent) is the treatment of choice in pregnant women with ACS/STEMI. Pregnancy may be considered in women with known CAD, if there is no residual ischemia and LVEF >40%.   6. Cardiomyopathies Peripartum cardiomyopathy includes LV systolic dysfunction without an identifiable cause in the last month of pregnancy or first months postpartum. Treatment follows ESC guidelines for HF, but with reservations regarding medications with possible harmful fetal effects. Prolactin derived peptides may contribute to the pathophysiology and bromocriptine may offer a novel possible specific therapeutic option. Deterioration in LV function occurs in up to 50% of cases despite optimal treatment. Subsequent pregnancies carry a recurrence risk of 30–50%. When ejection fraction has not normalized a subsequent pregnancy should be discouraged. Women with dilated cardiomyopathy should be informed about the risk of deterioration during gestation and peripartum. A LVEF <40% is a predictor of high risk. LVEF <20% implies a very high mortality and a termination of the pregnancy should be considered. Most women with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy tolerate pregnancy well. Use of ß-blockers is recommended if tolerated.   7. Arrhythmia Arrhythmias may become more frequent or may manifest for the first time during pregnancy. Arrhythmias requiring treatment develop in up to 15% of the patients with structural and congenital heart disease. In haemodynamically unstable patients with tachycardias, direct cardioversion should be considered. AV nodal re-entry tachycardia or AV re-entry tachycardia can be terminated by vagal manoeuvres or, if that fails, by intravenous adenosine. Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias during pregnancy are rare. The presence of an ICD does not itself contraindicate future pregnancy, Temporary pacing during delivery is recommended in presence of complete heart block and symptoms. The risks of permanent pacemaker implantation are generally low.   8. Hypertension Hypertension in pregnancy comprise pre-existing hypertension, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia Pre-eclampsia, defined as gestational hypertension with proteinuria >0.3 g/24 h, is the most common cause of prematurity. It occurs more frequently during the first pregnancy. While the benefits of antihypertensive therapy for mild-to-moderate gestational hypertension (<160/110 mmHg) have not been demonstrated in clinical trials, there is consensus that drug treatment of severe hypertension in pregancy is beneficial. Alpha-methyldopa is the drug of choice for long-term management of hypertension during pregnancy. Labetalol has comparable efficacy and can be given intravenously in severe hypertension. Calcium-channel blockers like nifedipine (oral) or isradipine (i.v.) are the drugs of second choice. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists and direct renin inhibitors are strictly contraindicated in pregnancy.   9. Venous thromboembolism during pregnancy and the puerperium Venous thromboembolism (VTE) represents a significant cause of pregnancy related morbidity and mortality. All women should undergo assessment of risk factors before or in early pregnancy. Increased risk for VTE in pregnancy: Previous recurrent VTE`s VTE unprovoked or oestrogen - related Single previous VTE + thrombophilia or family history. High risk patients should receive antenatal prophylaxis with LMWH and for 6 weeks postpartum.   10. Drug therapy in pregnancy There are no uniform recommendations. Different sources of evidence such as U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classification, internet databases, pharmaceutical industry recommendations have different strength and weaknesses. In case of emergency, drugs that are not recommended during pregnancy and breast feeding should not be withheld to the mother. The potential risk and benefit must be weighed against each other."

    "text": "General European databases on pregnancy complications are urgently needed. Foetal and maternal risk assessment need prospective and systematic studies.   Congenital heart disease What is the optimal way of delivery for the different diagnoses? What is the risk in the different diagnoses for irreversible effect of pregnancy on cardiac function?   Aortic disease What is the optimal way of delivery in women with dilated aorta? At what diameter should prophylactic aortic surgery by performed?   Valve thrombosis The superiority of unfractioned heparin or low-molecular weight heparin to prevent mechanical valve thrombosis and bleeding during the first trimester is unproven. There are insufficient data concerning optimal anti-factor Xa levels (post-dose as well as pre-dose) to prevent valve thrombosis and bleeding during low molecular weight heparin therapy. Randomized studies comparing OAC vrs LlMWH during the first trimester are needed.   Coronary heart disease The safety of thienopyridines, GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors and bivalirudin is unknown during pregnancy.   Heart failure and peripartum cardiomyopathy Systematic studies from European countries are not available. The etiology remains uncertain resulting in that no therapeutic but just symptomatic treatment is possible. Novel treatment options (bromocriptine, mechanical assist devices) need validation.   Arrhythmia Definite data on drug efficiency and safety are lacking.   Hypertension Prediction of pre-eclampsia needs improvement. There is no evidence that drug treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension in pregnancy is beneficial (most studies have serious limitations in study design such as small number of participants and no longitudinal outcome).   VTE The influence of various single risk factors and the summation of several risk factors on total VTE - risk needs to be defined more exactly in prospective studies and risk scores require prospective validation. Clinical prediction rules for assigning pretest probabilities of VTE and the use of various diagnostic modalities need validation in pregnant patients.   Drug therapy An European registry for complications of drug therapy in pregnancy is needed. Prospective studies should be designed wherever possible."
