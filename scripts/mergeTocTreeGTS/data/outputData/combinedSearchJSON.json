After age 74, FS screening should be discontinued There is limited evidence to support the efficacy of colonoscopy in reducing CRC incidence and mortality Colonoscopy screening may not be as effective in the right colon as in other segments of large bowel The age range is 50–74 years, with the optimal age for a single colonoscopy of ~55 years The optimal interval should not be less than 10 years and may be extended up to 20 years There is no evidence of extra benefit for adding a once-‍only sigmoidoscopy to FOBT screening New screening technologies are still under evaluation Computed tomography (CT) colonography, stool DNA testing and capsule endoscopy should not be used for screening in the average-‍risk population",

    "text": "STAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT Overview Once a colon cancer is diagnosed, clinical examination, laboratory tests and instrumental screening should be carried out in order to detect or to exclude metastatic disease Clinical examination may show visceromegaly (hepatomegaly or lymphadenopathy), ascites and/‍or synchronous tumours (mainly in women: Ovarian, endometrial and breast cancer) Ultrasonography of the liver and abdomen may be useful, but CT scan is usually more appropriate to detect metastatic spread to the liver or complications related to the tumour (e.g. perforation, fistula, obstruction) Sensitivity of CT scan in detecting peritoneal implants is relatively poor Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be useful for locally advanced tumours and could also be the preferred first-‍line investigation for evaluating liver metastases in patients who have not previously undergone therapy The routine use of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is not recommended at the time of initial diagnosis Pre-‍operative evaluation of the serum marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is useful for post-‍operative follow-‍up of CRC (or for use in treatment of metastatic disease) It has a low predictive value for diagnosis in asymptomatic patients but may have prognostic value in the pre-‍operative setting (>5 ng/dL suggests a worse prognosis) An increased pre-‍operative CEA value not normalised after one month following surgical resection may indicate persistent disease Surgical staging includes: Assessment of liver metastases Nodal spread of disease Extension of tumour through the bowel wall and onto adjacent structures For adequate pN-‍staging, at least 12 nodes should be examined Intra-‍operative ultrasound is a more accurate assessment for liver metastases The pathological stage must be reported according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/‍Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) tumour node metastisis (TNM) staging classification system (8th edition) (see tables) Although local failure rates are very low in colon cancer, systemic recurrence following surgery is frequent and is very often the ultimate cause of death The prognosis of colon cancer is influenced by multiple factors, including: Stage (TNM classification), including degree of penetration of the tumour through the bowel wall and the presence or absence of nodal involvement Pathohistological characteristics, such as grading, lymphatic or venous or perineural invasion, lymphoid inflammatory response and involvement of resection margins (Dukes’ and TNM classification) Pre-‍treatment serum levels of CEA and/‍or carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) Various molecular characteristics, including: Mismatch repair (MMR) system/microsatellite status (MMR deficient [dMMR]/ microsatellite instability [MSI]), p53, KRAS and bcl-2 expression, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), proliferation index and aneuploidy are under evaluation for their single or combined prognostic value in high-risk conditions Risk assessment plays an important role in determining the use of adjuvant therapy The most promising risk factors are allelic loss of chromosome 18q (negative for prognosis) and MSI/MMR (positive for prognosis) MSI/‍MMR may be useful to identify a small (10–15%) subset of patients with stage II disease who are at very low risk of recurrence and in whom the benefits of chemotherapy are very unlikely Other potential predictive markers include 18q deletion, KRAS mutations, TP53, TGF-β receptor II (TGFBR2), deleted in colon cancer (DCC) and thymidylate synthase (TS) gene expression Currently, there is no evidence for a predictive marker for adjuvant chemotherapy for early CRC, and so the use of any predictive marker information for decision making is not recommended Generally, adjuvant treatment is recommended for patients with stage III or high-‍risk stage II disease. Patients with stage II disease are considered as high risk if they present with at least one of the following clinical characteristics: Lymph nodes sampling < 12 Poorly differentiated tumour Vascular or lymphatic or perineural invasion Tumour presentation with obstruction Tumour perforation pT4 stage An age of more than 70 years at presentation is not a contraindication to standard therapies, although available evidence suggests that these patients do not derive significant benefit from oxaliplatin-‍based combinations in the adjuvant setting Nomograms that consider all proven prognostic factors in order to quantify the risk of 5- and 10-year death have been developed and are available for CRC",

For right sided colon cancers, the benefit is less obvious since anastomosis must be hand sewn which requires a laparotomy The long-‍term oncological results of laparoscopic colectomy are similar to those of the conventional approach Advantages of laparoscopy over a conventional approach are reduced pain, reduced length of hospital stay, and reduced duration of ileus A laparoscopic approach should only be performed: By technically experienced surgeons When no serious abdominal adhesion due to prior major abdominal surgery is present When there is no locally advanced disease and/‍or acute bowel obstruction or perforation Obstructive colorectal cancers can be treated in one or two stages Two stage procedures can include colostomy first followed by colonic resection, or Hartmann’s procedure first followed by colostomy closure and anastomosis A one stage procedure involves either subtotal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis or, in selected cases, segmental resection after intra-‍operative colonic lavage Endoscopic stenting can be used to relieve obstruction from rectosigmoid cancer and allow subsequent one step resection Obstructive right sided cancers can be treated by colonic resection and immediate anastomosis",

A single elevated PSA level should not prompt a prostate biopsy and should be verified by a second value The decision whether or not to have a prostate biopsy should be made in the light of digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, ethnicity, age, comorbidities, PSA values, free/‍total PSA, history of previous biopsy and patient values Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-‍guided prostate biopsy should be performed under antibiotic cover and local anaesthesia. A minimum of 10–12 cores should be obtained Prior to repeat biopsy, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended with a view to MRI-‍guided or MRI-‍TRUS fusion biopsy Indications for repeat biopsies include a rising PSA, suspicious DRE, abnormal multi-‍parametric MRI, atypical small acinar proliferation or multifocal high-‍grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia The extent of involvement of each biopsy core and the most common and the worst Gleason grades should be reported Biopsy pathology should be reported using the International Society of Urologic Pathology recommendations",

As such, there is an increased trend for penile-‍preserving strategies, despite the fact that recurrence rates may be higher than those of radical surgical procedures Patient preference as well as compliance in attending follow-‍up visits after treatment must be considered in treatment decisions Surgical techniques can be grouped into three broad categories: For small volume and superficial penile lesions, circumcision, wide local excision and epithelial ablative techniques are mainstay treatments For glanular and distal penile tumours, it is now possible to preserve much more length, and cosmetic and functional results are far superior to conventional partial penectomy Improvements in preservation techniques: Ongoing studies are evaluating less resection for superficial tumours and more penile reconstruction (phalloplasty) for more advanced tumours suitable only for total penectomy The role of salvage surgery after radio/‍chemotherapy remains controversial For patients with extensive regional disease in which primary surgery is deemed unlikely to result in a clear margin, attempts at down-‍staging are appropriate.

    "text": "10.2.2.0 Example of a basic oral care protocol TWO KEY STRATEGIES FOR MITIGATION OF ORAL MUCOSAL INJURY BEFORE AND DURING TREATMENT ARE: Maintenance of optimal nutritional support throughout the entire period of cancer therapy. Developing a daily oral hygiene routine, including brushing teeth and the gums four times a day with a soft brush and using mouth rinses. This approach can contribute to the reduction and, ideally, prevention of oral tissue injury and associated pain, nutritional compromise, and related adverse outcomes. The following information is presented as a portfolio of patient-‍‍based instructions for which health professional guidance is recommended General measures Inspect your oral mucosa daily Have your dental team eliminate sources of trauma (e.g. ill-‍fitting prostheses; fractured teeth) Lubricate lips with (sterile) vaseline/‍‍white paraffin (petrolatum), lip balm, or lip cream. Be aware that vaseline/‍‍white paraffin (petrolatum) should not be used chronically on the lips, as this promotes mucosal cell dehydration and is occlusive leading to risk of secondary infection Drink ample amount of fluids to keep the mouth moist Brushing teeth and gums Use a soft toothbrush or swab (as tolerated) after meals and before sleep. Brushing with a soft toothbrush reduces risk of bleeding. Each month you should utilise a new soft toothbrush Clean the dentition and gingiva with a mild fluoride-‍‍containing, non-‍foaming toothpaste Brush teeth twice a day (after meals and at bedtime) according to the Bass or modified Bass method. If using an electric toothbrush, utilise the techniques cited in the product description instead Rinse the brush thoroughly after use with water and store the toothbrush in a cup with the brush head facing upward If you are used to do so, clean the area between the teeth once a day. Consult a dental hygienist/‍‍dentist about the most appropriate interdental cleaner (floss, toothpick, brushes). In case you are not used to use interdental cleaners on a regular basis, do not start with it while on cancer therapy, since it can break the epithelial barrier, visible through gingival bleeding Rinse mouth Rinse mouth with an alcohol-‍‍free mouthwash upon awakening and at least four times a day after brushing, for 1 min with 15 mL mouthwash; gargle; and then spit out. During the first half hour after rinsing, avoid eating and drinking Denture care Remove dentures before performing oral care. Brush dentures with toothpaste and rinse with water; clean the gums Defer wearing dental prostheses as much as possible until the lining tissues of your mouth are healed. If in the hospital, soak the denture for 10 min in an antimicrobial solution (e.g. chlorhexidine 0.2% if available) before inserting in your mouth",

If patients find the mouthwash painful, they should be advised to use one of these approaches beforehand Analgesics: Expert opinion suggests that, with moderate pain, a topical NSAID (e.g. amlexanox 5% oral paste) may be considered to treat moderate pain from stomatitis. When NSAIDs are not tolerated, consider acetaminophen (paracetamol) as maintenance therapy in combination with an immediate release oral opioid or fast-acting fentanyl preparation (e.g. 50 μg fentanyl nasal spray) to relief pain short term, for instance before dinner. Fast-acting fentanyl preparations are registered for patients who are already treated with opioids, they may also be considered in this population because of their short-‍‍term pain relief Analgesics: Expert opinion suggests that with persistent severe pain more aggressive pain management may be considered to treat severe pain from stomatitis. Since oral complaints can complicate administration of drugs by mouth, one should consider other kinds of administration routes, such as transdermal or intranasal routes Other treatments: Expert opinion suggests that other treatments, such as coating agents, topical analgesic or anti-‍inflammatory agents, topical anaesthetics, and alternative mouthwashes may be considered to treat stomatitis Steroids; topical: Expert opinion suggests that with ulcers topical high potency corticosteroids should be considered first: dexamethasone mouth rinse (0.1 mg/mL) in case several locations of the oral cavity is involved or difficult to reach ulcerations; clobetasol gel or ointment (0.05%) in case of limited locations and easy to approach ulcers to treat mIAS Steroid; intralesional injection: Expert opinion suggests that, with no ulcer resolution, intralesional steroid injection (triamcinolone weekly; total dose 28 mg) in conjunction with oral expert AND topical clobetasol gel or ointment (0.05%) should be considered to treat mIAS Steroids; systemic: Expert opinion suggests that for highly symptomatic ulcers and for recurrent ulcers or oesophageal lesions, systemic corticosteroids as initial therapy to bring symptom under control quickly (high-‍dose pulse 30–60 mg or 1 mg/kg) oral prednisone/‍‍ prednisolone for 1 week followed by dose tapering over the second week should be considered to treat mIAS   Suggestions in favour of an intervention: based on expert opinion. mIAS, mTOR inhibitor-associated mucositis; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; WHO, World Health Organization",

    "text": "4.2.0.0 Mycosis fungoides (MF) and variants A stage-‍adapted conservative approach is recommended for MF and its variants Stage I: Patients with only patches and/‍or plaques covering < 10% (stage IA) or ≥ 10% (stage IB) of the skin surface should be treated with skin-‍directed therapies including topical steroids, psoralens and ultraviolet A (PUVA), narrow-band ultraviolet B (UVB) and topical cytostatic agents, e.g. mechlorethamine or carmustine Narrow-band UVB should be confined to patients with patches or very thin plaques Topical steroids are recommended as monotherapy for patches/flat plaques for stage IA disease; in stage IB topical steroids can be used as adjuvant therapy for selected skin lesions Local palliation of cutaneous and extracutaneous lesions may be achieved with local RT to doses ≥ 8 Gy Stage IIB: In patients developing one or a few infiltrated plaques or tumours (stage IIB), additional local radiotherapy (RT) may suffice and may be curative in patients with early localised disease (particularly unilesional MF and pagetoid reticulosis). In such cases local RT is most commonly administered with electrons (energy dependent on the thickness of the lesion), with bolus to achieve full skin dose, a margin of ≥ 2 cm and a total dose of 24–36 Gy For patients with more extensive infiltrated plaques and tumours or patients refractory to skin-‍directed therapies, a combination of PUVA and interferon alpha (IFN α) or PUVA and retinoids (including bexarotene), a combination of IFN-α and retinoids or total skin electron beam irradiation can be considered Total skin electron beam irradiation has traditionally been given at total doses of 30–36 Gy; lower doses (10–12 Gy) may suffice, with the option of retreatment For patients with advanced and refractory disease, gemcitabine or liposomal doxorubicin may be considered Stage IV: Multi-‍agent chemotherapy is only indicated in patients with effaced lymph nodes or visceral involvement, or in patients with widespread tumour stage MF, which cannot be controlled with skin-‍targeted and immunomodulating therapies In relatively young patients with refractory, progressive MF or SS, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) may be considered; the optimal conditioning regimen and timing are unknown",

Resection of PCNSL cannot be recommended because of the associated morbidity and lack of evidence for benefit Glucocorticoid therapy can interfere with an accurate histopathological diagnosis and so should be avoided before biopsy, without compromising the patient At diagnosis, contrast-‍enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cytological evaluation and flow cytometry of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are required Slit lamp examination should be carried out to investigate possible ocular involvement Computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis or a positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan is recommended to exclude systemic disease Testicular ultrasound examination is recommended for elderly men Although the value of a bone marrow examination is controversial, it is still part of baseline investigations in current clinical trials Most PCNSLs in immunocompetent patients are DLBCLs Extraneural dissemination is rare, but clonally related cells have been detected in the blood of some patients Many tumours express both germinal centre (GC) markers and the ABC marker IRF4 Activation of NFkB and BCR/‍MYD88 pathways and deletions of the HLA gene locus at 6p21.32 have been reported MYD88 mutations have been detected in 30–75% of cases, and CD79a/b mutations in up to 45%, with substantial overlap in positive cases",

Outside a clinical trial, there are insufficient data to support omission, particularly as relapses are difficult to salvage with poor outcomes Based on the good results achieved with rituximab chemotherapy combination regimens +/- RT, high-‍dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (HDCT/‍ASCT) is not recommended in patients who achieve complete remission (CR), even in initially poor-‍risk patients who attain an adequate response to initial therapy In young patients achieving less than a partial response, with an elevated FDG uptake at the post-chemoimmunotherapy PET-CT scan, if residual disease is confirmed by biopsy when feasible, intensification with HDCT/‍ASCT is recommended Post-‍treatment evaluation A PET-CT scan has an excellent negative predictive value However, the high frequency of false positive results necessitates further investigation of positive scans before planned therapy is modified Post-‍treatment PET-CT response evaluation should not be carried out until at least 5–6 weeks from the last chemotherapy infusion Serial scanning may be required to fully evaluate areas of residual post-treatment PET tracer uptake, with many patients manifesting gradual resolution Relapsed/‍refractory PMBCL The probability of recurrence after successful initial therapy for PMBCL appears to be lower than for other DLBCLs Patients who achieve a response lasting longer than 18 months are likely to be cured Salvage treatment strategies of relapsed/resistant patients are similar to nodal DLBCLs, and include attempting reinduction with non-‍cross-‍resistant agents followed by consolidation with HDCT/‍ASCT in patients with chemosensitive disease If not a component of initial therapy, RT should be incorporated into the treatment programme for relapsed disease, ideally post-‍transplant, if significant mediastinal or lung volumes are involved",

    "text": "4.4.0.0 PCNSL First-‍line treatment Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is a standard approach. Due to disease relapses in almost all patients after a few months and a median survival of only 12 months, the addition of chemotherapy is recommended High-‍dose MTX (HD-‍MTX; at least 3 g/m² over 2-4-hour rapid infusion time) is considered the most effective single agent, although CR rates are usually < 30% A randomised phase II study showed the addition of high-‍dose cytarabine (HD-AraC) to significantly improve response rate (RR) and failure-‍free survival but single-‍arm studies have shown no clear benefit with the addition of other agents, including ifosfamide, thiotepa, procarbazine, vincristine and temozolomide The role of prophylactic IT chemotherapy is unclear Some studies have shown no benefit of adding IT chemotherapy to systemic HD-‍MTX but others have suggested a reduction in relapse rate with intraventricular administration combined with MTX-‍based chemotherapy IT chemotherapy cannot be routinely recommended for use with appropriate systemic chemotherapy, but could be considered for severe meningeal involvement RT (40 and 45 Gy in 20–25 fractions) is primarily used as consolidative therapy following HD-‍MTX-‍based chemotherapy Higher RT doses are associated with an increased risk of neurotoxicity, which is particularly pronounced in older patients Lower RT doses (30–36 Gy for WBRT or 23.4 Gy after chemotherapy-induced CR) appear to be effective and do not exhibit prohibitive RT-‍related toxicity, even in elderly patients An alternative consolidation strategy is HDCT/‍ASCT, which, mostly using thiotepa-‍based conditioning regimens, has shown overall remission rates of up to 91% and a 5-year OS of 87% To avoid WBRT, dose-‍intensive consolidation with conventional chemotherapy, such as etoposide and Arac, after HD-‍MTX-‍based induction can be used Preliminary results of a clinical study suggest the benefit on RR, progression-‍free survival (PFS) and OS of adding rituximab and thiotepa in newly-‍diagnosed disease and are supported by a retrospective series investigating rituximab combined with HD-‍MTX Elderly patients (age > 70 years or patients with comorbidities) Selected elderly patients are often able to tolerate HD-‍MTX-‍based treatment, with dosage guided by renal function In a systematic review and patient data meta-‍analysis, HD-‍MTX-‍based treatment was associated with an improved survival outcome Further combinations with oral alkylating agents, such as lomustine (CCNU) and procarbazine +/- vincristine, are feasible and active and comparison with HD-‍MTX is warranted WBRT should not be routinely used in front-‍line therapy in elderly patients able to tolerate other therapies, due to its high rate of neurotoxicity, and should be reserved for frail patients or those with refractory disease In summary, HD-‍MTX-‍based regimens, in combination with HD-‍AraC, are recommended for induction treatment, based on patient age, PS and organ function Consolidation RT should be avoided in elderly patients achieving CR and lower doses of WBRT (36 Gy or 23.4 Gy), based on response, are preferable for those not reaching CR Whether RT can safely be omitted without compromising long-‍term outcome in younger patients in CR remains controversial HDCT/‍ASCT as consolidation treatment could be considered as an alternative to WBRT in eligible patients Post-‍treatment evaluation Brain MRI is the standard for response evaluation CSF analysis (cytology and flow cytometry) should be added for patients with previous CSF involvement, with spinal imaging as clinically indicated Brain MRI monitoring may help to rule out progression but the clinical utility of such a surveillance strategy is unproven For patients with prior CSF or ocular involvement, specific assessments (i.e. CSF evaluation or ophthalmologic evaluation) are needed Based on the rarity of systemic progression, additional systemic evaluation (i.e. CT or CT-PET scans) is indicated only in case of clinical signs or symptoms Relapsed/‍refractory PCNSL In patients with disease relapse after HD-‍MTX, HDCT/‍ASCT is associated with a median survival of 18.3 months (58.6 months for those who received HDCT/‍ASCT) Temozolomide (with or without rituximab), topotecan and pemetrexed are the only agents that have been investigated prospectively in relapsed/refractory disease and none showed sufficient activity to be established as the standard approach Re-‍exposure to the same HD-‍MTX-‍based protocol can be considered When RT is used as a single modality therapy, i.e. WBRT as primary treatment for non-‍candidates for chemotherapy, higher doses (40–50 Gy, 1.5–1.8 Gy/‍fraction) are required Doses of 36 Gy have been shown to be beneficial in a salvage setting, but the optimal dose and the role of boost doses remains uncertain In summary, choice of salvage treatments depends on the clinical status, toxicities from previous treatments and duration of remission No standard protocol can currently be recommended Fit patients should be considered for HDCT/‍ASCT WBRT remains an important palliative treatment for patients unable to tolerate (or those relapsing after) high-‍dose, CNS-‍penetrating chemotherapy and who are not fit for further chemotherapy",

Outside a clinical trial, there are insufficient data to support omission, particularly as relapses are difficult to salvage with poor outcomes Based on the good results achieved with rituximab chemotherapy combination regimens +/- RT, HDCT/‍ASCT is not recommended in patients who achieve CR, even in initially poor-‍risk patients who attain an adequate response to initial therapy In young patients achieving less than a partial response, with an elevated FDG uptake at the post-chemoimmunotherapy PET-CT scan, if residual disease is confirmed by biopsy when feasible, intensification with HDCT/‍ASCT is recommended Post-‍treatment evaluation A PET-CT scan has an excellent negative predictive value However, the high frequency of false positive results necessitates further investigation of positive scans before planned therapy is modified Post-‍treatment PET-CT response evaluation should not be carried out until at least 5–6 weeks from the last chemotherapy infusion Serial scanning may be required to fully evaluate areas of residual post-treatment PET tracer uptake, with many patients manifesting gradual resolution Relapsed/‍refractory PMBCL The probability of recurrence after successful initial therapy for PMBCL appears to be lower than for other DLBCLs Patients who achieve a response lasting longer than 18 months are likely to be cured Salvage treatment strategies of relapsed/resistant patients are similar to nodal DLBCLs, and include attempting reinduction with non-‍cross-‍resistant agents followed by consolidation with HDCT/‍ASCT in patients with chemosensitive disease If not a component of initial therapy, RT should be incorporated into the treatment programme for relapsed disease, ideally post-‍transplant, if significant mediastinal or lung volumes are involved",

    "text": "7.3.4.0 PCNSL First-‍line treatment WBRT is a standard approach. Due to disease relapses in almost all patients after a few months and a median survival of only 12 months, the addition of chemotherapy is recommended HD-‍MTX (at least 3 g/m² over 2–4-hour rapid infusion time) is considered the most effective single agent, although CR rates are usually <30% A randomised phase II study showed the addition of HD-‍ara-‍C to significantly improve RR and failure-‍free survival but single-‍arm studies have shown no clear benefit with the addition of other agents, including ifosfamide, thiotepa, procarbazine, vincristine and temozolomide The role of prophylactic IT chemotherapy is unclear Some studies have shown no benefit of adding IT chemotherapy to systemic HD-‍MTX but others have suggested a reduction in relapse rate with intraventricular administration combined with MTX-‍based chemotherapy IT chemotherapy cannot be routinely recommended for use with appropriate systemic chemotherapy, but could be considered for severe meningeal involvement RT (40 and 45 Gy in 20–25 fractions) is primarily used as consolidative therapy following HD-‍MTX-‍based chemotherapy Higher RT doses are associated with an increased risk of neurotoxicity, which is particularly pronounced in older patients Lower RT doses (30–36 Gy for WBRT or 23.4 Gy after chemotherapy-induced CR) appear to be effective and do not exhibit prohibitive RT-‍related toxicity, even in elderly patients An alternative consolidation strategy is HDCT/‍ASCT, which, mostly using thiotepa-‍based conditioning regimens, has shown overall remission rates of up to 91% and a 5-year OS of 87% To avoid WBRT, dose-‍intensive consolidation with conventional chemotherapy, such as etoposide and ara-C, after HD-‍MTX-‍based induction can be used Preliminary results of a clinical study suggest the benefit on RR, PFS and OS of adding rituximab and thiotepa in newly-‍diagnosed disease and are supported by a retrospective series investigating rituximab combined with HD-‍MTX Elderly patients (age >70 years or patients with comorbidities) Selected elderly patients are often able to tolerate HD-‍MTX-‍based treatment, with dosage guided by renal function In a systematic review and patient data meta-‍analysis, HD-‍MTX-‍based treatment was associated with an improved survival outcome Further combinations with oral alkylating agents, such as CCNU and procarbazine +/- vincristine, are feasible and active and comparison with HD-‍MTX is warranted WBRT should not be routinely used in front-‍line therapy in elderly patients able to tolerate other therapies, due to its high rate of neurotoxicity, and should be reserved for frail patients or those with refractory disease In summary, HD-‍MTX-‍based regimens, in combination with HD-‍ara-‍C, are recommended for induction treatment, based on patient age, PS and organ function Consolidation RT should be avoided in elderly patients achieving CR and lower doses of WBRT (36 Gy or 23.4 Gy), based on response, are preferable for those not reaching CR Whether RT can safely be omitted without compromising long-‍term outcome in younger patients in CR remains controversial HDCT/‍ASCT as consolidation treatment could be considered as an alternative to WBRT in eligible patients Post-‍treatment evaluation Brain MRI is the standard for response evaluation CSF analysis (cytology and flow cytometry) should be added for patients with previous CSF involvement, with spinal imaging as clinically indicated Brain MRI monitoring may help to rule out progression but the clinical utility of such a surveillance strategy is unproven For patients with prior CSF or ocular involvement, specific assessments (i.e. CSF evaluation or ophthalmologic evaluation) are needed Based on the rarity of systemic progression, additional systemic evaluation (i.e. CT or CT/‍PET scans) is indicated only in case of clinical signs or symptoms Relapsed/‍refractory PCNSL In patients with disease relapse after HD-‍MTX, HDCT/‍ASCT is associated with a median survival of 18.3 months (58.6 months for those who received HDCT/‍ASCT) Temozolomide (with or without rituximab), topotecan and pemetrexed are the only agents that have been investigated prospectively in relapsed/refractory disease and none showed sufficient activity to be established as the standard approach Re-‍exposure to the same HD-‍MTX-‍based protocol can be considered When RT is used as a single modality therapy, i.e. WBRT as primary treatment for non-‍candidates for chemotherapy, higher doses (40–50 Gy, 1.5–1.8 Gy/ fraction) are required Doses of 36 Gy have been shown to be beneficial in a salvage setting, but the optimal dose and the role of boost doses remains uncertain In summary, choice of salvage treatments depends on the clinical status, toxicities from previous treatments and duration of remission No standard protocol can currently be recommended Fit patients should be considered for HDCT/‍ASCT WBRT remains an important palliative treatment for patients unable to tolerate (or those relapsing after) high-‍dose, CNS-‍penetrating chemotherapy and who are not fit for further chemotherapy",

Larger atypical lymphocytes or prolymphocytes must not exceed 55% CLL cells co-‍express the CD5 antigen and the B-‍cell surface antigens CD19, CD20 and CD23 Distinguishing CLL from other lymphoma entities is crucial Staining for cyclin D1 or SOX 11, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) for detecting translocation (11;14) and FMC7 analysis can help to distinguish CLL from mantle cell lymphoma Negative or lower CD43 expression may help to distinguish marginal zone lymphoma or lymphoblastic lymphoma from CLL According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, CLL and small lymphocytic leukaemia (SLL) are a single entity A diagnosis of SLL requires the presence of lymphadenopathy and/‍or splenomegaly with a peripheral blood B-‍lymphocyte count of ≤ 5 × 109/L The diagnosis of SLL should be confirmed by histopathological evaluation of a lymph node biopsy, when possible In the absence of lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, cytopaenia and clinical symptoms, a monoclonal B-‍lymphocyte count of < 5 × 109/L defines monoclonal B-‍lymphocytosis",

It is also effective as a 2-hour infusion once per week over 6 courses Responses (CR and PR) are similar regardless of weekly or daily administration, and when given as a SC injection SC administration of cladribine is given for 5–7 days and is considered to be easier than administration by IV as it does not require hospitalisation Lower total doses (0.5 mg/kg) are associated with fewer cases of grade 3–4 toxicity (primarily neutropenic fevers and infections) than higher total doses (0.7 mg/kg) Patients who achieve a PR after the first course of cladribine should receive a second course (with or without rituximab) at least 6 months after the end of the first course to achieve a CR Pentostatin In patients with normal creatinine clearance (> 60 mL/‍min), pentostatin is typically administered at a dose of 4 mg/m2 IV every second week until CR Full blood count usually normalises after 8–9 courses and a bone marrow biopsy should be performed to confirm a CR Interferon-‍α The role of IFNα is limited in the treatment of HCL; purine analogues induce higher and more durable remissions and are more convenient for patients IFNα may be indicated in pregnant patients or in those with very severe neutropaenia (neutrophil count < 0.2 x 109/L) prior to therapy with nucleoside analogues",

    "text": "Diagnosis Shortness of breath, pain and weight loss are common symptoms and can occur over many months Unilateral effusions are often observed on physical examination The work-‍up should include: chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan of chest and upper abdomen, thoracentesis, general laboratory blood tests and a detailed occupational history Plain chest radiography lacks sufficient sensitivity for routine staging as pleural effusions of large volume can mask pleural/chest lesions or make it difficult to detect small malignant pleural effusions When occupational history indicates significant asbestos exposure, or radiology is suggestive of mesothelioma, cytology or histology can be used, although histology is preferred Thoracoscopy is recommended to obtain adequate histology, to optimally stage and to allow pleural fluid evacuation (with or without pleurodesis) and can be performed as a pleuroscopy or as video-‍assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) Biopsies of normal and abnormal tissue are recommended Ultrasound-‍guided true-‍cut biopsies are a good alternative when thoracoscopy is not feasible or is contraindicated The circulating tumour markers cyfra 21.1, fibulin-‍3 and mesothelin should not be used as specific markers for mesothelioma. However, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is not increased in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and can be used as a negative marker to rule this out if cytological/‍histological analysis is inconclusive A summary of recommendations for diagnostic procedures is given below RECOMMENDATION 1 Diagnostic procedures in MPM should encompass at least: Occupational history with emphasis on asbestos exposure CT scanning of the thorax In all patients who have a unilateral pleural thickening, with or without fluid and/‍or calcified asbestos plaques, efforts should be made to obtain a pathological specimen, since there are no specific clinical features of MPM There is no place for screening of persons exposed to asbestos Tumour markers cannot distinguish MPM CT, computed tomography; MPM, malignant pleural mesothelioma",

    "text": "Pathlology The three main subtypes of MPM (epitheloid, biphasic and sarcomatoid) have numerous variants Samples for diagnosis include: pleural effusions, small (closed) pleural biopsies, image-‍guided needle core biopsies, larger open surgery or VATS biopsy samples of debulking specimens Significant sampling errors can occur in effusion cytology and small biopsy samples and, less commonly, with larger surgical samples Blind biopsies are not recommended because of the risk of complications Reported diagnostic sensitivities of cytological features in effusions vary and this is generally not recommended to establish a definitive diagnosis. When a biopsy is not possible, appropriate clinical and radiological features may assist in suggesting a diagnosis of MPM In the vast majority of cases, adequate tissue biopsy and appropriate immunohistochemistry (IHC) is required for the definitive primary diagnosis of MPM Definitive diagnosis by frozen section is not recommended The larger the tissue biopsy and the more targeted the sampling approach, the more reliable and definitive the diagnosis Identification of the extent of invasion is crucial and can be assisted by IHC Early invasive mesothelioma may be suspected if there is nodular mesothelial cell proliferation If definitive invasion cannot be recognised, a diagnosis of ‘atypical mesothelial proliferation’ is appropriate and further sampling may be indicated Distinguishing MPM from organising fibrinous exudates (fibrinous/fibrous pleurisy) requires a full thickness biopsy sample The most commonly used mesothelial markers are calretinin, cytokeratin 5/6, WT1 and podplanin (D2-40), with TTF-1, CEA and Ep-CAM (Ber-EP4) being the most useful for (adeno)carcinoma Pancytokeratin markers can be useful in the diagnosis of sarcomatoid mesothelioma, which does not express the usual mesothelial markers The role of fluorescence in situ hybridisation in detecting homozygous deletion of p16 for MPM diagnosis has yet to be established A summary of recommendations for pathological samples used in MPM diagnosis is given below RECOMMENDATION 2 A. Definitive diagnosis of MPM on effusion cytology specimens Effusion cytology for definitive diagnosis of MPM remains a controversial topic and is still generally not recommended If effusion cytology is frankly malignant, the diagnosis may be strongly suggested but confirmation by biopsy, if possible, is recommended IHC is invaluable to characterise the nature of atypical effusion cells and sample preparation to facilitate IHC should be carried out if at all possible B. Definitive diagnosis of MPM on tissue biopsy specimens The recognition of tissue invasion is required for definitive diagnosis of MPM Larger and directly targeted biopsy samples facilitate definitive diagnosis.

FDG-‍PET should be carried out in patients who are candidates for oesophagectomy A tracheo-‍bronchoscopy should be carried out for tumours at or above the tracheal bifurcation to exclude tracheal invasion In the case of oesophageal SCC due to chronic tobacco and alcohol consumption, meticulous investigation of the oral cavity, oropharynx and hypopharynx by an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist, as well as tracheo-‍bronchoscopy to exclude a synchronous second cancer in the aerodigestive tract, should be carried out In locally advanced (T3/T4) ACs of the oesophago-‍gastric junction (OGJ) infiltrating the anatomic cardia, laparoscopy can be used to rule out peritoneal metastases, which are commonly found in 15% of patients Stage should be reported according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/‍Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) tumour node metastasis (TNM) staging system (7th edition), as shown in the table here Staging should be complemented by medical risk assessment, particularly in patients scheduled for multimodal therapy and/‍or surgery This comprises a differential blood count, liver, pulmonary, cardiac and renal function tests Independently from the body mass index, weight loss confers an increased operative risk, worsens a patient’s quality of life and is associated with poor survival in advanced disease Over half of patients lose more than 5% of their body weight before admission for oesophagectomy and over 40% lose more than 10% The patient’s nutritional status and history of weight loss should be assessed according to the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) and ESPEN guidelines-‍recommended nutritional support is an integral part of the medical care of patients in the curative and palliative settings",

Risk assessment differs by CCA subtype Risk factors for pCCA include primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and hepatobiliary flukes or hepatolithiasis Risk factors for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) are cirrhosis, hepatitis C and hepatitis B, although the development of a hepatocellular carcinoma is more likely in cirrhotic patients Surveillance is recommended for patients with pre-‍malignant lesions predisposing to GBC, the risk of malignancy being related to the size of gallbladder polyps Lesions ≥ 20mm should be managed as GBC after completion of staging investigations US surveillance is recommended for polyps measuring 6–9 mm (6-‍monthly for 1 year, then annually for 5 years) with resection only in enlarging polyps (to 10–20 mm)",

Eur Urol 2016;70:93–105. Changes to the WHO classification are summarised below The molecular genetic profile of ccRCC is frequently characterised by biallelic Von Hippel-‍Lindau (VHL) gene alterations; mutations in chromatin remodelling genes have also been reported Multilocular cystic ccRCC has been renamed multilocular cystic renal neoplasia of low malignant potential Papillary RCCs represent a heterogeneous disease including tumours with indolent outcome and tumours with aggressive and lethal phenotype. Hereditary leiomyomatosis-associated RCCs are usually Type 2 papillary RCC The oncocytic variant of papillary RCC should be reclassified as Type 1 (mainly) or Type 2 papillary RCC Papillary adenoma is defined as a papillary renal tumour < 15 mm in its largest dimension The main prognostic factors in chromophobe RCC are: tumour stage, presence of necrosis, a sarcomatoid and/‍or rhabdoid component and small vessel invasion Hybrid tumours present overlapping features of oncocytomas and chromophobe RCCs and have indolent behaviour The diagnosis of collecting duct carcinoma is based on six histological features: Medullary location, infiltrative growth pattern, tubular architecture, desmoplastic stromal reaction, high grade atypia and that the tumour is neither an RCC nor a transitional cell carcinoma Renal medullary carcinoma occurs in young patients with sickle traits and is histologically similar to collecting duct carcinoma The diagnosis of MiTF translocation RCCs, which occur in young patients, is based on a strong nuclear TFE3/TFEB immunoreactivity and the presence of a translocation involving TFE3 or TFEB genes: t(X;1)(p11.2;q21) and t(6,11) (p21;q12), respectively Epithelioid angiomyolipoma (AML) is recognised as a separate entity with a risk of progression or metastasis. Risk factors for progression are: association with tuberous sclerosis, multiple AML, presence of necrosis, tumour size > 7 cm, extrarenal extension and/‍or renal vein invasion and presence of a carcinoma-‍like growth pattern Two new entities are now recognised Acquired cystic disease-‍associated RCCs that have indolent outcome and occur in patients with end-‍stage renal disease and acquired cystic disease Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-‍deficient RCCs that occur in patients with germline mutations in an SDH gene Prognostic factors to be reported in routine practice are: Histological subtype; International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) nucleolar grading (ccRCC and papillary RCC only); sarcomatoid and/‍or rhabdoid differentiation that defines a grade 4 tumour; necrosis; microscopic vascular invasion; and tumour node metastasis (TNM) staging",

TNM 8 staging, alongside the patient’s cardiopulmonary fitness, should be used to determine the choice of treatment In the UICC TNM 8, the T stage has been further subdivided according to tumour size: T1 into T1a ≤ 1 cm, T1b > 1 cm to ≤ 2 cm, T1c > 2 cm to ≤ 3 cm T2 into T2a > 3 cm to ≤ 4 cm, T2b > 4 cm to ≤ 5 cm T3 > 5 cm to ≤ 7 cm T4 > 7 cm For part-‍solid tumours, the size of the invasive component should be used to assign the T category for clinical staging; however the whole size of the tumour should also be recorded Subsolid lesions require dedicated radiological expertise to evaluate the lung lesion composition The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) has proposed: determining the T of multifocal ground glass/‍lepidic tumours by the highest T-‍lesion, with either the number of tumours or m in parentheses to denote the multifocal nature; and that a single N and M category be used for all these lesions collectively In daily practice, simply using m is preferred over trying to estimate the number of ground glass opacity (GGO) areas For pneumonic tumours, the IASLC suggests using size (or T3) if in one lobe, T4 if involving a different ipsilateral lobe, and M1a if contralateral; in this situation, the T stage will be based on the highest category in the most involved lung CT follow-‍up studies have shown that incidental non-‍calcified non-‍solid lung lesions do not need repeat CT examinations more frequently than every 1–2 years; these lesions are definitely less aggressive than solid or part-‍solid lesions and often even indolent If two lung lesions fulfil the criteria for two primaries, then these should be evaluated, staged and treated accordingly Concluding that two foci are indeed two different primaries is difficult; often it will be impossible to come to a definitive conclusion and the role of an MDT is important The TNM 8 staging suggests leaving the N categories unchanged from TNM 7, but suggests recording for future testing the sub-‍classification of single (N1a, N2a) or multiple (N1b, N2b) affected nodes For patients with abnormal mediastinal and/‍or hilar LNs using CT and/‍or PET, endosonography is recommended over surgical staging The preferred first technique for pathological confirmation of suspect nodes is needle aspiration under EBUS and/‍or EUS guidance If EBUS and/‍or EUS does not reveal nodal involvement in a situation of high clinical suspicion, mediastinoscopy is indicated Mediastinoscopy is the test with the highest negative predictive value (NPV) to rule out mediastinal LN disease A suggested algorithm for the locoregional staging of LNs is shown here Screening for brain metastases by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be useful in patients considered for curative therapy",

    "text": "4.6.0.0 Pretreatment risk assessment A therapeutic intervention for lung cancer reduces the pulmonary and vascular reserve capacity, either acutely following resection, or more gradually following radiotherapy (RT) Functional loss needs to be estimated pre-‍therapy to determine whether the patient will be able to cope and maintain an acceptable quality of life The risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality can be estimated using riskspecific models, although none have been validated in a cancer population In non-‍metastatic NSCLC, the cardiopulmonary fitness of the patient will determine the choice of treatment; before considering surgical resection, precise assessment of cardiac and pulmonary function is necessary to estimate risk of operative morbidity Formal lung function testing should be used to estimate postoperative lung function. An example preoperative respiratory evaluation algorithm here Surgical resection is usually acceptable if the predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) values are > 40% For patients with FEV1 and DLCO values > 80% of their predicted pulmonary function tests and no other major comorbidities, no further investigations are advised before surgical resection For others, exercise testing and split lung function are recommended; maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) can be used to measure exercise capacity and predict postoperative complications Standard risk assessments are not always directly applicable, as resection of poorly functioning parts of the lung might improve the situation instead of making it worse For example, in patients with limited pulmonary function due to emphysema, a lung volume reduction effect may be observed by resection of the lung cancer within emphysematous lung tissue. Treatment of such patients is considered in the algorithm here For cardiac assessment, use of the recalibrated thoracic revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) shown in the table below is recommended.

    "text": "DIAGNOSIS Formal diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is based on either tissue specimen or, in selected cases, very specific computed tomography (CT)/ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, often referred to as ‘non-‍invasive’ criteria Pathological diagnosis of HCC requires a biopsy of the tumour or a resection specimen, and preferably contains surrounding non-tumoural parenchyma for comparison Stromal or tumour cell invasion into the portal tracts or fibrous septa, defines HCC and is not present in dysplastic lesions Other histological features of HCC may also be seen in dysplastic lesions: Increased cell density (more than twice that of the surrounding tissue) with increased nuclear/‍cytoplasm ratio and irregular thin-‍trabecular pattern Intratumoural portal tract(s) Pseudoglandular pattern Diffuse fatty change (up to 40% in early, well-‍differentiated tumours, uncommon in tumours >3 cm) Varying numbers of unpaired arteries Additional immunohistochemical (IHC) staining may be helpful Neovascularisation can be assessed by a CD34 stain Non-‍invasive diagnosis of HCC is only possible in cirrhotic patients and requires state-‍of-‍the-‍art imaging techniques, such as: Multiple-‍phase multidetector CT scan Dynamic contrast-‍enhanced MRI Diagnosis should be based on the identification of the typical vascular hallmark of HCC Hypervascular in the arterial phase with washout in the portal venous or delayed phases Contrast-‍enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is less suitable for non-‍invasive diagnosis of HCC since a lesion that displays hypervascularisation and venous washout on CEUS may also be a cholangiocarcinoma Angiography and 18Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-‍PET) are not recommended for early diagnosis Every decision regarding the biopsy of a focal liver lesion should be discussed by the multidisciplinary team (MDT), including hepatobiliary and transplant surgeons A negative biopsy does not rule out malignancy There is no indication for biopsy of a focal lesion in a cirrhotic liver in the following situations: When no form of therapy can be offered because of serious comorbidity In cases of decompensated cirrhosis and the patient is on the waiting list for liver transplantation When the patient is a candidate for resection that can be carried out with an acceptable morbidity and mortality risk",

    "text": "RISK FACTORS AND SCREENING Risk factors for developing colon cancer can be classified as: Lifestyle and behavioural factors, e.g. smoking, high red meat consumption, obesity, physical inactivity Genetic factors Individuals with any of the following are considered at high risk and should be actively screened: A personal history of adenoma, colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) Significant family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) or polyps An inherited syndrome, such as: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) coli and its variants Lynch-‍associated syndromes Turcot-‍, Peutz-‍Jeghers-‍ and MUTYH-‍associated polyposis syndromes In cases of inherited syndromes, a referral for genetic counselling is also recommended The aim of screening is to detect pre-cancerous conditions and early stage malignancies which can be treated with curative therapy For average risk populations, the European Guidelines for quality assurance in CRC screening and diagnosis provides guiding principles and evidence-‍based recommendations on quality assurance which should be followed when implementing CRC screening using the various modalities currently adopted in publically mandated programmes in European Union (EU) member States These recommendations are: For men and women aged 50–74 years, only the faecal occult blood test (FOBT) has been recommended The benefit from annual screening appears to be greater than for biennial screening The test interval should not exceed two years The faecal immunochemical test (FIT) appears to be superior to guaiac (g)FOBT in terms of detection rate and positive predictive value for adenomas and cancer The test interval should not exceed three years Flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) reduces CRC incidence and mortality when performed in an organised screening programme The optimal interval should not be less than 10 years and may even be extended to 20 years The best age range is likely to be between 55 and 64 years. After age 74, FS screening should be discontinued There is limited evidence to support the efficacy of colonoscopy in reducing CRC incidence and mortality Colonoscopy screening may not be as effective in the right colon as in other segments of large bowel The age range is 50–74 years, with the optimal age for a single colonoscopy of ~55 years The optimal interval should not be less than 10 years and may be extended up to 20 years There is no evidence of extra benefit for adding a once-‍only sigmoidoscopy to FOBT screening New screening technologies are still under evaluation Computed tomography (CT) colonography, stool DNA testing and capsule endoscopy should not be used for screening in the average-‍risk population",

    "text": "STAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT Overview Once a colon cancer is diagnosed, clinical examination, laboratory tests and instrumental screening should be carried out in order to detect or to exclude metastatic disease Clinical examination may show visceromegaly (hepatomegaly or lymphadenopathy), ascites and/‍or synchronous tumours (mainly in women: Ovarian, endometrial and breast cancer) Ultrasonography of the liver and abdomen may be useful, but CT scan is usually more appropriate to detect metastatic spread to the liver or complications related to the tumour (e.g. perforation, fistula, obstruction) Sensitivity of CT scan in detecting peritoneal implants is relatively poor Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be useful for locally advanced tumours and could also be the preferred first-‍line investigation for evaluating liver metastases in patients who have not previously undergone therapy The routine use of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is not recommended at the time of initial diagnosis Pre-‍operative evaluation of the serum marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is useful for post-‍operative follow-‍up of CRC (or for use in treatment of metastatic disease) It has a low predictive value for diagnosis in asymptomatic patients but may have prognostic value in the pre-‍operative setting (>5 ng/dL suggests a worse prognosis) An increased pre-‍operative CEA value not normalised after one month following surgical resection may indicate persistent disease Surgical staging includes: Assessment of liver metastases Nodal spread of disease Extension of tumour through the bowel wall and onto adjacent structures For adequate pN-‍staging, at least 12 nodes should be examined Intra-‍operative ultrasound is a more accurate assessment for liver metastases The pathological stage must be reported according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/‍Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) tumour node metastisis (TNM) staging classification system (8th edition) (see tables) Although local failure rates are very low in colon cancer, systemic recurrence following surgery is frequent and is very often the ultimate cause of death The prognosis of colon cancer is influenced by multiple factors, including: Stage (TNM classification), including degree of penetration of the tumour through the bowel wall and the presence or absence of nodal involvement Pathohistological characteristics, such as grading, lymphatic or venous or perineural invasion, lymphoid inflammatory response and involvement of resection margins (Dukes’ and TNM classification) Pre-‍treatment serum levels of CEA and/‍or carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) Various molecular characteristics, including: Mismatch repair (MMR) system/microsatellite status (MMR deficient [dMMR]/ microsatellite instability [MSI]), p53, KRAS and bcl-2 expression, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), proliferation index and aneuploidy are under evaluation for their single or combined prognostic value in high-risk conditions Risk assessment plays an important role in determining the use of adjuvant therapy The most promising risk factors are allelic loss of chromosome 18q (negative for prognosis) and MSI/MMR (positive for prognosis) MSI/‍MMR may be useful to identify a small (10–15%) subset of patients with stage II disease who are at very low risk of recurrence and in whom the benefits of chemotherapy are very unlikely Other potential predictive markers include 18q deletion, KRAS mutations, TP53, TGF-β receptor II (TGFBR2), deleted in colon cancer (DCC) and thymidylate synthase (TS) gene expression Currently, there is no evidence for a predictive marker for adjuvant chemotherapy for early CRC, and so the use of any predictive marker information for decision making is not recommended Generally, adjuvant treatment is recommended for patients with stage III or high-‍risk stage II disease. Patients with stage II disease are considered as high risk if they present with at least one of the following clinical characteristics: Lymph nodes sampling < 12 Poorly differentiated tumour Vascular or lymphatic or perineural invasion Tumour presentation with obstruction Tumour perforation pT4 stage An age of more than 70 years at presentation is not a contraindication to standard therapies, although available evidence suggests that these patients do not derive significant benefit from oxaliplatin-‍based combinations in the adjuvant setting Nomograms that consider all proven prognostic factors in order to quantify the risk of 5- and 10-year death have been developed and are available for CRC",

For right sided colon cancers, the benefit is less obvious since anastomosis must be hand sewn which requires a laparotomy The long-‍term oncological results of laparoscopic colectomy are similar to those of the conventional approach Advantages of laparoscopy over a conventional approach are reduced pain, reduced length of hospital stay, and reduced duration of ileus A laparoscopic approach should only be performed: By technically experienced surgeons When no serious abdominal adhesion due to prior major abdominal surgery is present When there is no locally advanced disease and/‍or acute bowel obstruction or perforation Obstructive colorectal cancers can be treated in one or two stages Two stage procedures can include colostomy first followed by colonic resection, or Hartmann’s procedure first followed by colostomy closure and anastomosis A one stage procedure involves either subtotal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis or, in selected cases, segmental resection after intra-‍operative colonic lavage Endoscopic stenting can be used to relieve obstruction from rectosigmoid cancer and allow subsequent one step resection Obstructive right sided cancers can be treated by colonic resection and immediate anastomosis",

A minimum of 10–12 cores should be obtained Prior to repeat biopsy, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended with a view to MRI-‍guided or MRI-‍TRUS fusion biopsy Indications for repeat biopsies include a rising PSA, suspicious DRE, abnormal multi-‍parametric MRI, atypical small acinar proliferation or multifocal high-‍grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia The extent of involvement of each biopsy core and the most common and the worst Gleason grades should be reported Biopsy pathology should be reported using the International Society of Urologic Pathology recommendations",

As such, there is an increased trend for penile-‍preserving strategies, despite the fact that recurrence rates may be higher than those of radical surgical procedures Patient preference as well as compliance in attending follow-‍up visits after treatment must be considered in treatment decisions Surgical techniques can be grouped into three broad categories: For small volume and superficial penile lesions, circumcision, wide local excision and epithelial ablative techniques are mainstay treatments For glanular and distal penile tumours, it is now possible to preserve much more length, and cosmetic and functional results are far superior to conventional partial penectomy Improvements in preservation techniques: Ongoing studies are evaluating less resection for superficial tumours and more penile reconstruction (phalloplasty) for more advanced tumours suitable only for total penectomy The role of salvage surgery after radio/‍chemotherapy remains controversial For patients with extensive regional disease in which primary surgery is deemed unlikely to result in a clear margin, attempts at down-‍staging are appropriate.

Developing a daily oral hygiene routine, including brushing teeth and the gums four times a day with a soft brush and using mouth rinses. This approach can contribute to the reduction and, ideally, prevention of oral tissue injury and associated pain, nutritional compromise, and related adverse outcomes. The following information is presented as a portfolio of patient-‍‍based instructions for which health professional guidance is recommended General measures Inspect your oral mucosa daily Have your dental team eliminate sources of trauma (e.g. ill-‍fitting prostheses; fractured teeth) Lubricate lips with (sterile) vaseline/‍‍white paraffin (petrolatum), lip balm, or lip cream. Be aware that vaseline/‍‍white paraffin (petrolatum) should not be used chronically on the lips, as this promotes mucosal cell dehydration and is occlusive leading to risk of secondary infection Drink ample amount of fluids to keep the mouth moist Brushing teeth and gums Use a soft toothbrush or swab (as tolerated) after meals and before sleep. Brushing with a soft toothbrush reduces risk of bleeding. Each month you should utilise a new soft toothbrush Clean the dentition and gingiva with a mild fluoride-‍‍containing, non-‍foaming toothpaste Brush teeth twice a day (after meals and at bedtime) according to the Bass or modified Bass method. If using an electric toothbrush, utilise the techniques cited in the product description instead Rinse the brush thoroughly after use with water and store the toothbrush in a cup with the brush head facing upward If you are used to do so, clean the area between the teeth once a day. Consult a dental hygienist/‍‍dentist about the most appropriate interdental cleaner (floss, toothpick, brushes). In case you are not used to use interdental cleaners on a regular basis, do not start with it while on cancer therapy, since it can break the epithelial barrier, visible through gingival bleeding Rinse mouth Rinse mouth with an alcohol-‍‍free mouthwash upon awakening and at least four times a day after brushing, for 1 min with 15 mL mouthwash; gargle; and then spit out. During the first half hour after rinsing, avoid eating and drinking Denture care Remove dentures before performing oral care. Brush dentures with toothpaste and rinse with water; clean the gums Defer wearing dental prostheses as much as possible until the lining tissues of your mouth are healed. If in the hospital, soak the denture for 10 min in an antimicrobial solution (e.g. chlorhexidine 0.2% if available) before inserting in your mouth",

If patients find the mouthwash painful, they should be advised to use one of these approaches beforehand Analgesics: Expert opinion suggests that, with moderate pain, a topical NSAID (e.g. amlexanox 5% oral paste) may be considered to treat moderate pain from stomatitis. When NSAIDs are not tolerated, consider acetaminophen (paracetamol) as maintenance therapy in combination with an immediate release oral opioid or fast-acting fentanyl preparation (e.g. 50 μg fentanyl nasal spray) to relief pain short term, for instance before dinner. Fast-acting fentanyl preparations are registered for patients who are already treated with opioids, they may also be considered in this population because of their short-‍‍term pain relief Analgesics: Expert opinion suggests that with persistent severe pain more aggressive pain management may be considered to treat severe pain from stomatitis. Since oral complaints can complicate administration of drugs by mouth, one should consider other kinds of administration routes, such as transdermal or intranasal routes Other treatments: Expert opinion suggests that other treatments, such as coating agents, topical analgesic or anti-‍inflammatory agents, topical anaesthetics, and alternative mouthwashes may be considered to treat stomatitis Steroids; topical: Expert opinion suggests that with ulcers topical high potency corticosteroids should be considered first: dexamethasone mouth rinse (0.1 mg/mL) in case several locations of the oral cavity is involved or difficult to reach ulcerations; clobetasol gel or ointment (0.05%) in case of limited locations and easy to approach ulcers to treat mIAS Steroid; intralesional injection: Expert opinion suggests that, with no ulcer resolution, intralesional steroid injection (triamcinolone weekly; total dose 28 mg) in conjunction with oral expert AND topical clobetasol gel or ointment (0.05%) should be considered to treat mIAS Steroids; systemic: Expert opinion suggests that for highly symptomatic ulcers and for recurrent ulcers or oesophageal lesions, systemic corticosteroids as initial therapy to bring symptom under control quickly (high-‍dose pulse 30–60 mg or 1 mg/kg) oral prednisone/‍‍ prednisolone for 1 week followed by dose tapering over the second week should be considered to treat mIAS   Suggestions in favour of an intervention: based on expert opinion. mIAS, mTOR inhibitor-associated mucositis; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; WHO, World Health Organization",

If venous access continually proves difficult, placement of a CVAD should be considered Large veins in the forearm are recommended for peripheral administration Avoid cannulation over joints, the inner wrist and lower extremities Veins in the anticubital fossa or on the dorsum of the hand should not be used, particularly for vesicant drugs Avoid cannulation where lymphoedema is present Cannulation on the side of a mastectomy is still a matter of discussion Procedures After cannulation, blood flow should be checked; rinse with 10 mL of normal saline and check for signs of extravasation Flushing with 10–20 mL of saline solution between different drug infusions is recommended A blood return (flashback) should always be obtained before vesicants are administered and checked regularly throughout a bolus infusion Continue monitoring of the cannula insertion site and check regularly for symptoms such as swelling, pain, redness or a sluggish infusion rate Bolus dosages of vesicant drugs may be administered concurrently with fastrunning infusions of compatible IV fluid",

This quick reference booklet provides you with the most important content of the full ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) on the management of lymphomas (Hodgkin’s lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, gastric marginal zone lymphoma of MALT type, primary cutaneous lymphomas, peripheral T cell lymphomas, extranodal diffuse large B cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and hairy cell leukaemia). Key content includes diagnostic criteria, staging of disease, treatment plans and follow-‍up. The ESMO CPGs on lymphomas are intended to provide you with a set of recommendations for the best standards of care for lymphoma, using evidence-‍based medicine. Implementation of ESMO CPGs facilitates knowledge uptake and helps you to deliver an appropriate quality of focused care to your patients. Please note that this document is not exhaustive and it may be important to refer to the full CPGs for critical clinical decision-‍making. The approval and licensed indication of drugs mentioned in this pocket guideline may vary in different countries. Please consult your local prescribing information. This booklet can be used as a quick reference guide to access key content on evidence-‍based management of lymphomas.

In such cases local RT is most commonly administered with electrons (energy dependent on the thickness of the lesion), with bolus to achieve full skin dose, a margin of ≥ 2 cm and a total dose of 24–36 Gy For patients with more extensive infiltrated plaques and tumours or patients refractory to skin-‍directed therapies, a combination of PUVA and interferon alpha (IFN α) or PUVA and retinoids (including bexarotene), a combination of IFN-α and retinoids or total skin electron beam irradiation can be considered Total skin electron beam irradiation has traditionally been given at total doses of 30–36 Gy; lower doses (10–12 Gy) may suffice, with the option of retreatment For patients with advanced and refractory disease, gemcitabine or liposomal doxorubicin may be considered Stage IV: Multi-‍agent chemotherapy is only indicated in patients with effaced lymph nodes or visceral involvement, or in patients with widespread tumour stage MF, which cannot be controlled with skin-‍targeted and immunomodulating therapies In relatively young patients with refractory, progressive MF or SS, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) may be considered; the optimal conditioning regimen and timing are unknown",

Key content includes diagnostic criteria, staging of disease, treatment plans and follow-‍up. The ESMO CPGs on lymphomas are intended to provide you with a set of recommendations for the best standards of care for lymphoma, using evidence-‍based medicine. Implementation of ESMO CPGs facilitates knowledge uptake and helps you to deliver an appropriate quality of focused care to your patients. Please note that this document is not exhaustive and it may be important to refer to the full CPGs for critical clinical decision-‍making. The approval and licensed indication of drugs mentioned in this pocket guideline may vary in different countries. Please consult your local prescribing information. This booklet can be used as a quick reference guide to access key content on evidence-‍based management of lymphomas.

Due to disease relapses in almost all patients after a few months and a median survival of only 12 months, the addition of chemotherapy is recommended High-‍dose MTX (HD-‍MTX; at least 3 g/m² over 2-4-hour rapid infusion time) is considered the most effective single agent, although CR rates are usually < 30% A randomised phase II study showed the addition of high-‍dose cytarabine (HD-AraC) to significantly improve response rate (RR) and failure-‍free survival but single-‍arm studies have shown no clear benefit with the addition of other agents, including ifosfamide, thiotepa, procarbazine, vincristine and temozolomide The role of prophylactic IT chemotherapy is unclear Some studies have shown no benefit of adding IT chemotherapy to systemic HD-‍MTX but others have suggested a reduction in relapse rate with intraventricular administration combined with MTX-‍based chemotherapy IT chemotherapy cannot be routinely recommended for use with appropriate systemic chemotherapy, but could be considered for severe meningeal involvement RT (40 and 45 Gy in 20–25 fractions) is primarily used as consolidative therapy following HD-‍MTX-‍based chemotherapy Higher RT doses are associated with an increased risk of neurotoxicity, which is particularly pronounced in older patients Lower RT doses (30–36 Gy for WBRT or 23.4 Gy after chemotherapy-induced CR) appear to be effective and do not exhibit prohibitive RT-‍related toxicity, even in elderly patients An alternative consolidation strategy is HDCT/‍ASCT, which, mostly using thiotepa-‍based conditioning regimens, has shown overall remission rates of up to 91% and a 5-year OS of 87% To avoid WBRT, dose-‍intensive consolidation with conventional chemotherapy, such as etoposide and Arac, after HD-‍MTX-‍based induction can be used Preliminary results of a clinical study suggest the benefit on RR, progression-‍free survival (PFS) and OS of adding rituximab and thiotepa in newly-‍diagnosed disease and are supported by a retrospective series investigating rituximab combined with HD-‍MTX Elderly patients (age > 70 years or patients with comorbidities) Selected elderly patients are often able to tolerate HD-‍MTX-‍based treatment, with dosage guided by renal function In a systematic review and patient data meta-‍analysis, HD-‍MTX-‍based treatment was associated with an improved survival outcome Further combinations with oral alkylating agents, such as lomustine (CCNU) and procarbazine +/- vincristine, are feasible and active and comparison with HD-‍MTX is warranted WBRT should not be routinely used in front-‍line therapy in elderly patients able to tolerate other therapies, due to its high rate of neurotoxicity, and should be reserved for frail patients or those with refractory disease In summary, HD-‍MTX-‍based regimens, in combination with HD-‍AraC, are recommended for induction treatment, based on patient age, PS and organ function Consolidation RT should be avoided in elderly patients achieving CR and lower doses of WBRT (36 Gy or 23.4 Gy), based on response, are preferable for those not reaching CR Whether RT can safely be omitted without compromising long-‍term outcome in younger patients in CR remains controversial HDCT/‍ASCT as consolidation treatment could be considered as an alternative to WBRT in eligible patients Post-‍treatment evaluation Brain MRI is the standard for response evaluation CSF analysis (cytology and flow cytometry) should be added for patients with previous CSF involvement, with spinal imaging as clinically indicated Brain MRI monitoring may help to rule out progression but the clinical utility of such a surveillance strategy is unproven For patients with prior CSF or ocular involvement, specific assessments (i.e. CSF evaluation or ophthalmologic evaluation) are needed Based on the rarity of systemic progression, additional systemic evaluation (i.e. CT or CT-PET scans) is indicated only in case of clinical signs or symptoms Relapsed/‍refractory PCNSL In patients with disease relapse after HD-‍MTX, HDCT/‍ASCT is associated with a median survival of 18.3 months (58.6 months for those who received HDCT/‍ASCT) Temozolomide (with or without rituximab), topotecan and pemetrexed are the only agents that have been investigated prospectively in relapsed/refractory disease and none showed sufficient activity to be established as the standard approach Re-‍exposure to the same HD-‍MTX-‍based protocol can be considered When RT is used as a single modality therapy, i.e. WBRT as primary treatment for non-‍candidates for chemotherapy, higher doses (40–50 Gy, 1.5–1.8 Gy/‍fraction) are required Doses of 36 Gy have been shown to be beneficial in a salvage setting, but the optimal dose and the role of boost doses remains uncertain In summary, choice of salvage treatments depends on the clinical status, toxicities from previous treatments and duration of remission No standard protocol can currently be recommended Fit patients should be considered for HDCT/‍ASCT WBRT remains an important palliative treatment for patients unable to tolerate (or those relapsing after) high-‍dose, CNS-‍penetrating chemotherapy and who

Outside a clinical trial, there are insufficient data to support omission, particularly as relapses are difficult to salvage with poor outcomes Based on the good results achieved with rituximab chemotherapy combination regimens +/- RT, HDCT/‍ASCT is not recommended in patients who achieve CR, even in initially poor-‍risk patients who attain an adequate response to initial therapy In young patients achieving less than a partial response, with an elevated FDG uptake at the post-chemoimmunotherapy PET-CT scan, if residual disease is confirmed by biopsy when feasible, intensification with HDCT/‍ASCT is recommended Post-‍treatment evaluation A PET-CT scan has an excellent negative predictive value However, the high frequency of false positive results necessitates further investigation of positive scans before planned therapy is modified Post-‍treatment PET-CT response evaluation should not be carried out until at least 5–6 weeks from the last chemotherapy infusion Serial scanning may be required to fully evaluate areas of residual post-treatment PET tracer uptake, with many patients manifesting gradual resolution Relapsed/‍refractory PMBCL The probability of recurrence after successful initial therapy for PMBCL appears to be lower than for other DLBCLs Patients who achieve a response lasting longer than 18 months are likely to be cured Salvage treatment strategies of relapsed/resistant patients are similar to nodal DLBCLs, and include attempting reinduction with non-‍cross-‍resistant agents followed by consolidation with HDCT/‍ASCT in patients with chemosensitive disease If not a component of initial therapy, RT should be incorporated into the treatment programme for relapsed disease, ideally post-‍transplant, if significant mediastinal or lung volumes are involved",

Due to disease relapses in almost all patients after a few months and a median survival of only 12 months, the addition of chemotherapy is recommended HD-‍MTX (at least 3 g/m² over 2–4-hour rapid infusion time) is considered the most effective single agent, although CR rates are usually <30% A randomised phase II study showed the addition of HD-‍ara-‍C to significantly improve RR and failure-‍free survival but single-‍arm studies have shown no clear benefit with the addition of other agents, including ifosfamide, thiotepa, procarbazine, vincristine and temozolomide The role of prophylactic IT chemotherapy is unclear Some studies have shown no benefit of adding IT chemotherapy to systemic HD-‍MTX but others have suggested a reduction in relapse rate with intraventricular administration combined with MTX-‍based chemotherapy IT chemotherapy cannot be routinely recommended for use with appropriate systemic chemotherapy, but could be considered for severe meningeal involvement RT (40 and 45 Gy in 20–25 fractions) is primarily used as consolidative therapy following HD-‍MTX-‍based chemotherapy Higher RT doses are associated with an increased risk of neurotoxicity, which is particularly pronounced in older patients Lower RT doses (30–36 Gy for WBRT or 23.4 Gy after chemotherapy-induced CR) appear to be effective and do not exhibit prohibitive RT-‍related toxicity, even in elderly patients An alternative consolidation strategy is HDCT/‍ASCT, which, mostly using thiotepa-‍based conditioning regimens, has shown overall remission rates of up to 91% and a 5-year OS of 87% To avoid WBRT, dose-‍intensive consolidation with conventional chemotherapy, such as etoposide and ara-C, after HD-‍MTX-‍based induction can be used Preliminary results of a clinical study suggest the benefit on RR, PFS and OS of adding rituximab and thiotepa in newly-‍diagnosed disease and are supported by a retrospective series investigating rituximab combined with HD-‍MTX Elderly patients (age >70 years or patients with comorbidities) Selected elderly patients are often able to tolerate HD-‍MTX-‍based treatment, with dosage guided by renal function In a systematic review and patient data meta-‍analysis, HD-‍MTX-‍based treatment was associated with an improved survival outcome Further combinations with oral alkylating agents, such as CCNU and procarbazine +/- vincristine, are feasible and active and comparison with HD-‍MTX is warranted WBRT should not be routinely used in front-‍line therapy in elderly patients able to tolerate other therapies, due to its high rate of neurotoxicity, and should be reserved for frail patients or those with refractory disease In summary, HD-‍MTX-‍based regimens, in combination with HD-‍ara-‍C, are recommended for induction treatment, based on patient age, PS and organ function Consolidation RT should be avoided in elderly patients achieving CR and lower doses of WBRT (36 Gy or 23.4 Gy), based on response, are preferable for those not reaching CR Whether RT can safely be omitted without compromising long-‍term outcome in younger patients in CR remains controversial HDCT/‍ASCT as consolidation treatment could be considered as an alternative to WBRT in eligible patients Post-‍treatment evaluation Brain MRI is the standard for response evaluation CSF analysis (cytology and flow cytometry) should be added for patients with previous CSF involvement, with spinal imaging as clinically indicated Brain MRI monitoring may help to rule out progression but the clinical utility of such a surveillance strategy is unproven For patients with prior CSF or ocular involvement, specific assessments (i.e. CSF evaluation or ophthalmologic evaluation) are needed Based on the rarity of systemic progression, additional systemic evaluation (i.e. CT or CT/‍PET scans) is indicated only in case of clinical signs or symptoms Relapsed/‍refractory PCNSL In patients with disease relapse after HD-‍MTX, HDCT/‍ASCT is associated with a median survival of 18.3 months (58.6 months for those who received HDCT/‍ASCT) Temozolomide (with or without rituximab), topotecan and pemetrexed are the only agents that have been investigated prospectively in relapsed/refractory disease and none showed sufficient activity to be established as the standard approach Re-‍exposure to the same HD-‍MTX-‍based protocol can be considered When RT is used as a single modality therapy, i.e. WBRT as primary treatment for non-‍candidates for chemotherapy, higher doses (40–50 Gy, 1.5–1.8 Gy/ fraction) are required Doses of 36 Gy have been shown to be beneficial in a salvage setting, but the optimal dose and the role of boost doses remains uncertain In summary, choice of salvage treatments depends on the clinical status, toxicities from previous treatments and duration of remission No standard protocol can currently be recommended Fit patients should be considered for HDCT/‍ASCT WBRT remains an important palliative treatment for patients unable to tolerate (or those relapsing after) high-‍dose, CNS-‍penetrating chemotherapy and who are not fit for further chemotherapy",

Larger atypical lymphocytes or prolymphocytes must not exceed 55% CLL cells co-‍express the CD5 antigen and the B-‍cell surface antigens CD19, CD20 and CD23 Distinguishing CLL from other lymphoma entities is crucial Staining for cyclin D1 or SOX 11, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) for detecting translocation (11;14) and FMC7 analysis can help to distinguish CLL from mantle cell lymphoma Negative or lower CD43 expression may help to distinguish marginal zone lymphoma or lymphoblastic lymphoma from CLL According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, CLL and small lymphocytic leukaemia (SLL) are a single entity A diagnosis of SLL requires the presence of lymphadenopathy and/‍or splenomegaly with a peripheral blood B-‍lymphocyte count of ≤ 5 × 109/L The diagnosis of SLL should be confirmed by histopathological evaluation of a lymph node biopsy, when possible In the absence of lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, cytopaenia and clinical symptoms, a monoclonal B-‍lymphocyte count of < 5 × 109/L defines monoclonal B-‍lymphocytosis",

It is also effective as a 2-hour infusion once per week over 6 courses Responses (CR and PR) are similar regardless of weekly or daily administration, and when given as a SC injection SC administration of cladribine is given for 5–7 days and is considered to be easier than administration by IV as it does not require hospitalisation Lower total doses (0.5 mg/kg) are associated with fewer cases of grade 3–4 toxicity (primarily neutropenic fevers and infections) than higher total doses (0.7 mg/kg) Patients who achieve a PR after the first course of cladribine should receive a second course (with or without rituximab) at least 6 months after the end of the first course to achieve a CR Pentostatin In patients with normal creatinine clearance (> 60 mL/‍min), pentostatin is typically administered at a dose of 4 mg/m2 IV every second week until CR Full blood count usually normalises after 8–9 courses and a bone marrow biopsy should be performed to confirm a CR Interferon-‍α The role of IFNα is limited in the treatment of HCL; purine analogues induce higher and more durable remissions and are more convenient for patients IFNα may be indicated in pregnant patients or in those with very severe neutropaenia (neutrophil count < 0.2 x 109/L) prior to therapy with nucleoside analogues",

However, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is not increased in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and can be used as a negative marker to rule this out if cytological/‍histological analysis is inconclusive A summary of recommendations for diagnostic procedures is given below RECOMMENDATION 1 Diagnostic procedures in MPM should encompass at least: Occupational history with emphasis on asbestos exposure CT scanning of the thorax In all patients who have a unilateral pleural thickening, with or without fluid and/‍or calcified asbestos plaques, efforts should be made to obtain a pathological specimen, since there are no specific clinical features of MPM There is no place for screening of persons exposed to asbestos Tumour markers cannot distinguish MPM CT, computed tomography; MPM, malignant pleural mesothelioma",

    "text": "Pathlology The three main subtypes of MPM (epitheloid, biphasic and sarcomatoid) have numerous variants Samples for diagnosis include: pleural effusions, small (closed) pleural biopsies, image-‍guided needle core biopsies, larger open surgery or VATS biopsy samples of debulking specimens Significant sampling errors can occur in effusion cytology and small biopsy samples and, less commonly, with larger surgical samples Blind biopsies are not recommended because of the risk of complications Reported diagnostic sensitivities of cytological features in effusions vary and this is generally not recommended to establish a definitive diagnosis. When a biopsy is not possible, appropriate clinical and radiological features may assist in suggesting a diagnosis of MPM In the vast majority of cases, adequate tissue biopsy and appropriate immunohistochemistry (IHC) is required for the definitive primary diagnosis of MPM Definitive diagnosis by frozen section is not recommended The larger the tissue biopsy and the more targeted the sampling approach, the more reliable and definitive the diagnosis Identification of the extent of invasion is crucial and can be assisted by IHC Early invasive mesothelioma may be suspected if there is nodular mesothelial cell proliferation If definitive invasion cannot be recognised, a diagnosis of ‘atypical mesothelial proliferation’ is appropriate and further sampling may be indicated Distinguishing MPM from organising fibrinous exudates (fibrinous/fibrous pleurisy) requires a full thickness biopsy sample The most commonly used mesothelial markers are calretinin, cytokeratin 5/6, WT1 and podplanin (D2-40), with TTF-1, CEA and Ep-CAM (Ber-EP4) being the most useful for (adeno)carcinoma Pancytokeratin markers can be useful in the diagnosis of sarcomatoid mesothelioma, which does not express the usual mesothelial markers The role of fluorescence in situ hybridisation in detecting homozygous deletion of p16 for MPM diagnosis has yet to be established A summary of recommendations for pathological samples used in MPM diagnosis is given below RECOMMENDATION 2 A. Definitive diagnosis of MPM on effusion cytology specimens Effusion cytology for definitive diagnosis of MPM remains a controversial topic and is still generally not recommended If effusion cytology is frankly malignant, the diagnosis may be strongly suggested but confirmation by biopsy, if possible, is recommended IHC is invaluable to characterise the nature of atypical effusion cells and sample preparation to facilitate IHC should be carried out if at all possible B. Definitive diagnosis of MPM on tissue biopsy specimens The recognition of tissue invasion is required for definitive diagnosis of MPM Larger and directly targeted biopsy samples facilitate definitive diagnosis. Surgical-‍type samples are preferred for diagnosis A major subtype diagnosis (epithelioid, biphasic, sarcomatoid) should be given in all cases of MPM C. IHC in the diagnosis of MPM IHC is recommended for all primary diagnoses of MPM At least two ‘mesothelial’ markers and at least two ‘(adeno)carcinoma’ markers should be used Sarcomatoid MPM often does not express usual ‘mesothelial’ markers IHC, immunohistochemistry; MPM, maligant pleural mesothelioma",

Eur Urol 2016;70:93–105. Changes to the WHO classification are summarised below The molecular genetic profile of ccRCC is frequently characterised by biallelic Von Hippel-‍Lindau (VHL) gene alterations; mutations in chromatin remodelling genes have also been reported Multilocular cystic ccRCC has been renamed multilocular cystic renal neoplasia of low malignant potential Papillary RCCs represent a heterogeneous disease including tumours with indolent outcome and tumours with aggressive and lethal phenotype. Hereditary leiomyomatosis-associated RCCs are usually Type 2 papillary RCC The oncocytic variant of papillary RCC should be reclassified as Type 1 (mainly) or Type 2 papillary RCC Papillary adenoma is defined as a papillary renal tumour < 15 mm in its largest dimension The main prognostic factors in chromophobe RCC are: tumour stage, presence of necrosis, a sarcomatoid and/‍or rhabdoid component and small vessel invasion Hybrid tumours present overlapping features of oncocytomas and chromophobe RCCs and have indolent behaviour The diagnosis of collecting duct carcinoma is based on six histological features: Medullary location, infiltrative growth pattern, tubular architecture, desmoplastic stromal reaction, high grade atypia and that the tumour is neither an RCC nor a transitional cell carcinoma Renal medullary carcinoma occurs in young patients with sickle traits and is histologically similar to collecting duct carcinoma The diagnosis of MiTF translocation RCCs, which occur in young patients, is based on a strong nuclear TFE3/TFEB immunoreactivity and the presence of a translocation involving TFE3 or TFEB genes: t(X;1)(p11.2;q21) and t(6,11) (p21;q12), respectively Epithelioid angiomyolipoma (AML) is recognised as a separate entity with a risk of progression or metastasis. Risk factors for progression are: association with tuberous sclerosis, multiple AML, presence of necrosis, tumour size > 7 cm, extrarenal extension and/‍or renal vein invasion and presence of a carcinoma-‍like growth pattern Two new entities are now recognised Acquired cystic disease-‍associated RCCs that have indolent outcome and occur in patients with end-‍stage renal disease and acquired cystic disease Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-‍deficient RCCs that occur in patients with germline mutations in an SDH gene Prognostic factors to be reported in routine practice are: Histological subtype; International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) nucleolar grading (ccRCC and papillary RCC only); sarcomatoid and/‍or rhabdoid differentiation that defines a grade 4 tumour; necrosis; microscopic vascular invasion; and tumour node metastasis (TNM) staging",

Conclusions from this finding are: To reinforce the use of EGFR antibody therapy in patients with mCRC and leftsided RAS wild-type tumours  To promote the idea that patients with right-sided RAS wild-type tumours might be better treated with chemotherapy alone or  chemotherapy plus bevacizumab To emphasise that in the absence of data on specific treatment sequences, there is no reason that EGFR-antibody therapy should be avoided in cases of disease progression or treatment intolerance independent of primary tumour location Patients should receive all three available cytotoxic agents and all suitable targeted agents during the course of their treatment, when possible, although the optimal sequence remains to be elucidated Around 70–80% of ‘fit’ patients should receive second-‍line therapy and 50–60% should receive third-‍line therapy",

Conclusions from this finding are: To reinforce the use of EGFR antibody therapy in patients with mCRC and leftsided RAS wild-type tumours To promote the idea that patients with right-sided RAS wild-type tumours might be better treated with chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus bevacizumab To emphasise that in the absence of data on specific treatment sequences, there is no reason that EGFR-antibody therapy should be avoided in cases of disease progression or treatment intolerance independent of primary tumour location Patients should receive all three available cytotoxic agents and all targeted agents during the course of their treatment, when possible, although the optimal sequence remains to be elucidated",

TNM 8 staging, alongside the patient’s cardiopulmonary fitness, should be used to determine the choice of treatment In the UICC TNM 8, the T stage has been further subdivided according to tumour size: T1 into T1a ≤ 1 cm, T1b > 1 cm to ≤ 2 cm, T1c > 2 cm to ≤ 3 cm T2 into T2a > 3 cm to ≤ 4 cm, T2b > 4 cm to ≤ 5 cm T3 > 5 cm to ≤ 7 cm T4 > 7 cm For part-‍solid tumours, the size of the invasive component should be used to assign the T category for clinical staging; however the whole size of the tumour should also be recorded Subsolid lesions require dedicated radiological expertise to evaluate the lung lesion composition The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) has proposed: determining the T of multifocal ground glass/‍lepidic tumours by the highest T-‍lesion, with either the number of tumours or m in parentheses to denote the multifocal nature; and that a single N and M category be used for all these lesions collectively In daily practice, simply using m is preferred over trying to estimate the number of ground glass opacity (GGO) areas For pneumonic tumours, the IASLC suggests using size (or T3) if in one lobe, T4 if involving a different ipsilateral lobe, and M1a if contralateral; in this situation, the T stage will be based on the highest category in the most involved lung CT follow-‍up studies have shown that incidental non-‍calcified non-‍solid lung lesions do not need repeat CT examinations more frequently than every 1–2 years; these lesions are definitely less aggressive than solid or part-‍solid lesions and often even indolent If two lung lesions fulfil the criteria for two primaries, then these should be evaluated, staged and treated accordingly Concluding that two foci are indeed two different primaries is difficult; often it will be impossible to come to a definitive conclusion and the role of an MDT is important The TNM 8 staging suggests leaving the N categories unchanged from TNM 7, but suggests recording for future testing the sub-‍classification of single (N1a, N2a) or multiple (N1b, N2b) affected nodes For patients with abnormal mediastinal and/‍or hilar LNs using CT and/‍or PET, endosonography is recommended over surgical staging The preferred first technique for pathological confirmation of suspect nodes is needle aspiration under EBUS and/‍or EUS guidance If EBUS and/‍or EUS does not reveal nodal involvement in a situation of high clinical suspicion, mediastinoscopy is indicated Mediastinoscopy is the test with the highest negative predictive value (NPV) to rule out mediastinal LN disease A suggested algorithm for the locoregional staging of LNs is shown here Screening for brain metastases by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be useful in patients considered for curative therapy",

An example preoperative respiratory evaluation algorithm here Surgical resection is usually acceptable if the predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) values are > 40% For patients with FEV1 and DLCO values > 80% of their predicted pulmonary function tests and no other major comorbidities, no further investigations are advised before surgical resection For others, exercise testing and split lung function are recommended; maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) can be used to measure exercise capacity and predict postoperative complications Standard risk assessments are not always directly applicable, as resection of poorly functioning parts of the lung might improve the situation instead of making it worse For example, in patients with limited pulmonary function due to emphysema, a lung volume reduction effect may be observed by resection of the lung cancer within emphysematous lung tissue. Treatment of such patients is considered in the algorithm here For cardiac assessment, use of the recalibrated thoracic revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) shown in the table below is recommended. The steps required to undertake preoperative cardiac evaluation are shown here (the figure is based on the original RCRI rather than the recalibrated RCRI) Comorbidities should be evaluated and optimised before surgery RECALIBRATED THORACIC REVISED CARDIAC RISK INDEX   POINTS Weighted factors   Ischaemic heart disease* 1.5 History of cerebrovascular disease† 1.5 Serum creatinine > 2 mg/dL 1 Pneumonectomy planned 1.5 Class groupings   A 0 B 1–1.5 C 2–2.5 D > 2.5 *Ischaemic heart disease: history of myocardial infarction, history of positive exercise test, current complaint of chest pain (myocardial ischaemia), nitrate therapy, ECG with pathological Q waves †Cerebrovascular disease: transient ischaemic attack, stroke ECG, electrocardiogram Adapted from Brunelli A et al.

    "text": "DIAGNOSIS Formal diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is based on either tissue specimen or, in selected cases, very specific computed tomography (CT)/ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, often referred to as ‘non-‍invasive’ criteria Pathological diagnosis of HCC requires a biopsy of the tumour or a resection specimen, and preferably contains surrounding non-tumoural parenchyma for comparison Stromal or tumour cell invasion into the portal tracts or fibrous septa, defines HCC and is not present in dysplastic lesions Other histological features of HCC may also be seen in dysplastic lesions: Increased cell density (more than twice that of the surrounding tissue) with increased nuclear/‍cytoplasm ratio and irregular thin-‍trabecular pattern Intratumoural portal tract(s) Pseudoglandular pattern Diffuse fatty change (up to 40% in early, well-‍differentiated tumours, uncommon in tumours >3 cm) Varying numbers of unpaired arteries Additional immunohistochemical (IHC) staining may be helpful Neovascularisation can be assessed by a CD34 stain Non-‍invasive diagnosis of HCC is only possible in cirrhotic patients and requires state-‍of-‍the-‍art imaging techniques, such as: Multiple-‍phase multidetector CT scan Dynamic contrast-‍enhanced MRI Diagnosis should be based on the identification of the typical vascular hallmark of HCC Hypervascular in the arterial phase with washout in the portal venous or delayed phases Contrast-‍enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is less suitable for non-‍invasive diagnosis of HCC since a lesion that displays hypervascularisation and venous washout on CEUS may also be a cholangiocarcinoma Angiography and 18Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-‍PET) are not recommended for early diagnosis Every decision regarding the biopsy of a focal liver lesion should be discussed by the multidisciplinary team (MDT), including hepatobiliary and transplant surgeons A negative biopsy does not rule out malignancy There is no indication for biopsy of a focal lesion in a cirrhotic liver in the following situations: When no form of therapy can be offered because of serious comorbidity In cases of decompensated cirrhosis and the patient is on the waiting list for liver transplantation When the patient is a candidate for resection that can be carried out with an acceptable morbidity and mortality risk",
