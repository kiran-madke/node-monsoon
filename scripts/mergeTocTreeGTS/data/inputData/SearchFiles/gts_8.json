This quick reference booklet provides you with the most important content of the full ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) on upper gastrointestinal (GI) tumours (oesophageal cancer, gastric cancer, biliary cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma). Key content includes diagnostic criteria, staging of disease, treatment plans and follow-‍‍up. The ESMO CPG on upper GI tumours are intended to provide you with a set of recommendations for the best standards of care for upper GI tumours, using evidence-‍‍based medicine. Implementation of ESMO CPG facilitates knowledge uptake and helps you to deliver an appropriate quality of focused care to your patients. The approval and licensed indication of drugs mentioned in this pocket guideline may vary in different countries. Please consult your local prescribing information. This booklet can be used as a quick reference guide to access key content on evidence-‍‍based management of upper GI tumours.

	"text":"Introduction DIAGNOSIS, PATHOLOGY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY Early symptoms may result  from a mass effect and include jaundice (for tumours of the head), abdominal pain, weight loss, steatorrhoea and new onset  diabetes Tumours located in the pancreas body and tail are more likely to be diagnosed at a more advanced stage than those located in the head, which can result in symptoms related to an obstruction of the common bile duct and/‍or pancreatic duct The majority of pancreatic cancers (95%) are adenocarcinomas, the most common being ductal adenocarcinoma Some variants, such as adenosquamous carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinomas with osteoclast-‍like giant cells, have poorer prognosis whereas acinar cell cancers have a better prognosis Mucinous lesions have the potential for malignant progression and/‍or may harbour a malignancy at the time of diagnosis The most frequent precursor lesions are microscopic pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and mucinous cystic neoplasm Commonly found genetic mutations involve combinations of: mutational activation of oncogenes, predominantly KRAS, found in > 90% of cases; inactivation of tumour suppressor genes, such as TP53, p16/CDKN2A and SMAD4; and inactivation of genome maintenance genes, such as nMLH1 and MSH2, which control DNA damage repair – most of these latter mutations are somatic aberrations On whole-‍genome sequencing, chromosomal rearrangements, affecting genes known to be important in pancreatic cancer and new candidate drivers (KDM6A and PREX2), were prevalent Chromosome structural variation can be used to classify pancreatic cancer into four sub-‍types – stable, locally rearranged, scattered, unstable – with potential clinical utility"
