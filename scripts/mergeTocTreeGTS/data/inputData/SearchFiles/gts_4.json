	"text":"Diagnosis Shortness of breath, pain and weight loss are common symptoms and can occur over many months Unilateral effusions are often observed on physical examination The work-‍up should include: chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan of chest and upper abdomen, thoracentesis, general laboratory blood tests and a detailed occupational history Plain chest radiography lacks sufficient sensitivity for routine staging as pleural effusions of large volume can mask pleural/chest lesions or make it difficult to detect small malignant pleural effusions When occupational history indicates significant asbestos exposure, or radiology is suggestive of mesothelioma, cytology or histology can be used, although histology is preferred Thoracoscopy is recommended to obtain adequate histology, to optimally stage and to allow pleural fluid evacuation (with or without pleurodesis) and can be performed as a pleuroscopy or as video-‍assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) Biopsies of normal and abnormal tissue are recommended Ultrasound-‍guided true-‍cut biopsies are a good alternative when thoracoscopy is not feasible or is contraindicated The circulating tumour markers cyfra 21.1, fibulin-‍3 and mesothelin should not be used as specific markers for mesothelioma. However, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is not increased in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and can be used as a negative marker to rule this out if cytological/‍histological analysis is inconclusive A summary of recommendations for diagnostic procedures is given below RECOMMENDATION 1 Diagnostic procedures in MPM should encompass at least: Occupational history with emphasis on asbestos exposure CT scanning of the thorax In all patients who have a unilateral pleural thickening, with or without fluid and/‍or calcified asbestos plaques, efforts should be made to obtain a pathological specimen, since there are no specific clinical features of MPM There is no place for screening of persons exposed to asbestos Tumour markers cannot distinguish MPM CT, computed tomography; MPM, malignant pleural mesothelioma"

	"text":"Pathlology The three main subtypes of MPM (epitheloid, biphasic and sarcomatoid) have numerous variants Samples for diagnosis include: pleural effusions, small (closed) pleural biopsies, image-‍guided needle core biopsies, larger open surgery or VATS biopsy samples of debulking specimens Significant sampling errors can occur in effusion cytology and small biopsy samples and, less commonly, with larger surgical samples Blind biopsies are not recommended because of the risk of complications Reported diagnostic sensitivities of cytological features in effusions vary and this is generally not recommended to establish a definitive diagnosis. When a biopsy is not possible, appropriate clinical and radiological features may assist in suggesting a diagnosis of MPM In the vast majority of cases, adequate tissue biopsy and appropriate immunohistochemistry (IHC) is required for the definitive primary diagnosis of MPM Definitive diagnosis by frozen section is not recommended The larger the tissue biopsy and the more targeted the sampling approach, the more reliable and definitive the diagnosis Identification of the extent of invasion is crucial and can be assisted by IHC Early invasive mesothelioma may be suspected if there is nodular mesothelial cell proliferation If definitive invasion cannot be recognised, a diagnosis of ‘atypical mesothelial proliferation’ is appropriate and further sampling may be indicated Distinguishing MPM from organising fibrinous exudates (fibrinous/fibrous pleurisy) requires a full thickness biopsy sample The most commonly used mesothelial markers are calretinin, cytokeratin 5/6, WT1 and podplanin (D2-40), with TTF-1, CEA and Ep-CAM (Ber-EP4) being the most useful for (adeno)carcinoma Pancytokeratin markers can be useful in the diagnosis of sarcomatoid mesothelioma, which does not express the usual mesothelial markers The role of fluorescence in situ hybridisation in detecting homozygous deletion of p16 for MPM diagnosis has yet to be established A summary of recommendations for pathological samples used in MPM diagnosis is given below RECOMMENDATION 2 A. Definitive diagnosis of MPM on effusion cytology specimens Effusion cytology for definitive diagnosis of MPM remains a controversial topic and is still generally not recommended If effusion cytology is frankly malignant, the diagnosis may be strongly suggested but confirmation by biopsy, if possible, is recommended IHC is invaluable to characterise the nature of atypical effusion cells and sample preparation to facilitate IHC should be carried out if at all possible B. Definitive diagnosis of MPM on tissue biopsy specimens The recognition of tissue invasion is required for definitive diagnosis of MPM Larger and directly targeted biopsy samples facilitate definitive diagnosis. Surgical-‍type samples are preferred for diagnosis A major subtype diagnosis (epithelioid, biphasic, sarcomatoid) should be given in all cases of MPM C. IHC in the diagnosis of MPM IHC is recommended for all primary diagnoses of MPM At least two ‘mesothelial’ markers and at least two ‘(adeno)carcinoma’ markers should be used Sarcomatoid MPM often does not express usual ‘mesothelial’ markers IHC, immunohistochemistry; MPM, maligant pleural mesothelioma"
