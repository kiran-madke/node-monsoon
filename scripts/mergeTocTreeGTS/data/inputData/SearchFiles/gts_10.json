	"text":"RISK FACTORS AND SCREENING Risk factors for developing colon cancer can be classified as: Lifestyle and behavioural factors, e.g. smoking, high red meat consumption, obesity, physical inactivity Genetic factors Individuals with any of the following are considered at high risk and should be actively screened: A personal history of adenoma, colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) Significant family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) or polyps An inherited syndrome, such as: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) coli and its variants Lynch-‍associated syndromes Turcot-‍, Peutz-‍Jeghers-‍ and MUTYH-‍associated polyposis syndromes In cases of inherited syndromes, a referral for genetic counselling is also recommended The aim of screening is to detect pre-cancerous conditions and early stage malignancies which can be treated with curative therapy For average risk populations, the European Guidelines for quality assurance in CRC screening and diagnosis provides guiding principles and evidence-‍based recommendations on quality assurance which should be followed when implementing CRC screening using the various modalities currently adopted in publically mandated programmes in European Union (EU) member States These recommendations are: For men and women aged 50–74 years, only the faecal occult blood test (FOBT) has been recommended The benefit from annual screening appears to be greater than for biennial screening The test interval should not exceed two years The faecal immunochemical test (FIT) appears to be superior to guaiac (g)FOBT in terms of detection rate and positive predictive value for adenomas and cancer The test interval should not exceed three years Flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) reduces CRC incidence and mortality when performed in an organised screening programme The optimal interval should not be less than 10 years and may even be extended to 20 years The best age range is likely to be between 55 and 64 years. After age 74, FS screening should be discontinued There is limited evidence to support the efficacy of colonoscopy in reducing CRC incidence and mortality Colonoscopy screening may not be as effective in the right colon as in other segments of large bowel The age range is 50–74 years, with the optimal age for a single colonoscopy of ~55 years The optimal interval should not be less than 10 years and may be extended up to 20 years There is no evidence of extra benefit for adding a once-‍only sigmoidoscopy to FOBT screening New screening technologies are still under evaluation Computed tomography (CT) colonography, stool DNA testing and capsule endoscopy should not be used for screening in the average-‍risk population"

	"text":"STAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT Overview Once a colon cancer is diagnosed, clinical examination, laboratory tests and instrumental screening should be carried out in order to detect or to exclude metastatic disease Clinical examination may show visceromegaly (hepatomegaly or lymphadenopathy), ascites and/‍or synchronous tumours (mainly in women: Ovarian, endometrial and breast cancer) Ultrasonography of the liver and abdomen may be useful, but CT scan is usually more appropriate to detect metastatic spread to the liver or complications related to the tumour (e.g. perforation, fistula, obstruction) Sensitivity of CT scan in detecting peritoneal implants is relatively poor Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be useful for locally advanced tumours and could also be the preferred first-‍line investigation for evaluating liver metastases in patients who have not previously undergone therapy The routine use of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is not recommended at the time of initial diagnosis Pre-‍operative evaluation of the serum marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is useful for post-‍operative follow-‍up of CRC (or for use in treatment of metastatic disease) It has a low predictive value for diagnosis in asymptomatic patients but may have prognostic value in the pre-‍operative setting (>5 ng/dL suggests a worse prognosis) An increased pre-‍operative CEA value not normalised after one month following surgical resection may indicate persistent disease Surgical staging includes: Assessment of liver metastases Nodal spread of disease Extension of tumour through the bowel wall and onto adjacent structures For adequate pN-‍staging, at least 12 nodes should be examined Intra-‍operative ultrasound is a more accurate assessment for liver metastases The pathological stage must be reported according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/‍Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) tumour node metastisis (TNM) staging classification system (8th edition) (see tables) Although local failure rates are very low in colon cancer, systemic recurrence following surgery is frequent and is very often the ultimate cause of death The prognosis of colon cancer is influenced by multiple factors, including: Stage (TNM classification), including degree of penetration of the tumour through the bowel wall and the presence or absence of nodal involvement Pathohistological characteristics, such as grading, lymphatic or venous or perineural invasion, lymphoid inflammatory response and involvement of resection margins (Dukes’ and TNM classification) Pre-‍treatment serum levels of CEA and/‍or carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) Various molecular characteristics, including: Mismatch repair (MMR) system/microsatellite status (MMR deficient [dMMR]/ microsatellite instability [MSI]), p53, KRAS and bcl-2 expression, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), proliferation index and aneuploidy are under evaluation for their single or combined prognostic value in high-risk conditions Risk assessment plays an important role in determining the use of adjuvant therapy The most promising risk factors are allelic loss of chromosome 18q (negative for prognosis) and MSI/MMR (positive for prognosis) MSI/‍MMR may be useful to identify a small (10–15%) subset of patients with stage II disease who are at very low risk of recurrence and in whom the benefits of chemotherapy are very unlikely Other potential predictive markers include 18q deletion, KRAS mutations, TP53, TGF-β receptor II (TGFBR2), deleted in colon cancer (DCC) and thymidylate synthase (TS) gene expression Currently, there is no evidence for a predictive marker for adjuvant chemotherapy for early CRC, and so the use of any predictive marker information for decision making is not recommended Generally, adjuvant treatment is recommended for patients with stage III or high-‍risk stage II disease. Patients with stage II disease are considered as high risk if they present with at least one of the following clinical characteristics: Lymph nodes sampling < 12 Poorly differentiated tumour Vascular or lymphatic or perineural invasion Tumour presentation with obstruction Tumour perforation pT4 stage An age of more than 70 years at presentation is not a contraindication to standard therapies, although available evidence suggests that these patients do not derive significant benefit from oxaliplatin-‍based combinations in the adjuvant setting Nomograms that consider all proven prognostic factors in order to quantify the risk of 5- and 10-year death have been developed and are available for CRC"
