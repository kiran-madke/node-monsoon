This quick reference booklet provides you with the most important content of the full ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) on the management of lymphomas (Hodgkin’s lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, gastric marginal zone lymphoma of MALT type, primary cutaneous lymphomas, peripheral T cell lymphomas, extranodal diffuse large B cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and hairy cell leukaemia). Key content includes diagnostic criteria, staging of disease, treatment plans and follow-‍up. The ESMO CPGs on lymphomas are intended to provide you with a set of recommendations for the best standards of care for lymphoma, using evidence-‍based medicine. Implementation of ESMO CPGs facilitates knowledge uptake and helps you to deliver an appropriate quality of focused care to your patients. Please note that this document is not exhaustive and it may be important to refer to the full CPGs for critical clinical decision-‍making. The approval and licensed indication of drugs mentioned in this pocket guideline may vary in different countries. Please consult your local prescribing information. This booklet can be used as a quick reference guide to access key content on evidence-‍based management of lymphomas.

In such cases local RT is most commonly administered with electrons (energy dependent on the thickness of the lesion), with bolus to achieve full skin dose, a margin of ≥ 2 cm and a total dose of 24–36 Gy For patients with more extensive infiltrated plaques and tumours or patients refractory to skin-‍directed therapies, a combination of PUVA and interferon alpha (IFN α) or PUVA and retinoids (including bexarotene), a combination of IFN-α and retinoids or total skin electron beam irradiation can be considered Total skin electron beam irradiation has traditionally been given at total doses of 30–36 Gy; lower doses (10–12 Gy) may suffice, with the option of retreatment For patients with advanced and refractory disease, gemcitabine or liposomal doxorubicin may be considered Stage IV: Multi-‍agent chemotherapy is only indicated in patients with effaced lymph nodes or visceral involvement, or in patients with widespread tumour stage MF, which cannot be controlled with skin-‍targeted and immunomodulating therapies In relatively young patients with refractory, progressive MF or SS, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) may be considered; the optimal conditioning regimen and timing are unknown"
