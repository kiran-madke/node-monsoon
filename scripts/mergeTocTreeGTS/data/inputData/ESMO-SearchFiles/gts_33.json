This quick reference booklet provides you with the most important content of the full ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) on the management of lymphomas (Hodgkin’s lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, gastric marginal zone lymphoma of MALT type, primary cutaneous lymphomas, peripheral T cell lymphomas, extranodal diffuse large B cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and hairy cell leukaemia). Key content includes diagnostic criteria, staging of disease, treatment plans and follow-‍up. The ESMO CPGs on lymphomas are intended to provide you with a set of recommendations for the best standards of care for lymphoma, using evidence-‍based medicine. Implementation of ESMO CPGs facilitates knowledge uptake and helps you to deliver an appropriate quality of focused care to your patients. Please note that this document is not exhaustive and it may be important to refer to the full CPGs for critical clinical decision-‍making. The approval and licensed indication of drugs mentioned in this pocket guideline may vary in different countries. Please consult your local prescribing information. This booklet can be used as a quick reference guide to access key content on evidence-‍based management of lymphomas. Please visit http://www.esmo.org or http:/‍/‍oncologypro.esmo.org to view the full guidelines."

	"text":"2.0.0.0 Diagnosis Diagnosis of Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (WM) requires demonstration of an IgM monoclonal protein and histological evidence of infiltration of the bone marrow (BM) by lymphoplasmacytic cells (documented by trephine biopsy and aspiration) BM infiltration should be routinely confirmed by immunophenotypic studies (flow cytometry and/‍or immunohistochemistry [IHC]) showing expression of CD19, CD20, CD22 and CD79a The presence of monoclonal IgM should be confirmed by immunofixation; determination of IgM levels may be based on either densitometry or total serum IgM quantitation by nephelometry (sequential assessments in the same patients should always be conducted with the same assay) Coombs test (for IgM-‍associated coagulopathy and haemolysis) and testing for cold agglutinin disease and coagulation parameter are recommended The presence of the MYD88 L265P variant serves as an additional diagnostic tool to separate WM from other entities such as multiple myeloma"

First-‍line Options include: Alkylating agents, nucleoside analogues, bortezomib (where available in first-‍line) and rituximab The combination of rituximab with chemotherapy is the first option and should be considered in medically fit patients and in those needing a rapid response Options for rituximab in combination with alkylating agents are dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide/rituximab (DCR) or rituximab plus cyclophosphamide/‍doxorubicin/‍vincristine/‍prednisone (R-‍CHOP) Rituximab may be combined with purine analogues such as cladribine or fludarabine; bendamustine is also highly effective in combination with rituximab Bortezomib (where available in first-‍line) (with or without dexamethasone) in combination with rituximab shows considerable activity In medically unfit patients, single-‍agent rituximab is a treatment option but can induce rapid increase of IgM values (so called &#39;IgM flare&#39;). Thus, in patients with signs of hyperviscosity or high IgM values, plasmapheresis must precede rituximab application Ibrutinib may be considered for patients not eligible for chemotherapy (approved indication) A treatment algorithm for first-‍line therapy is shown in these figures, for newly diagnosed see here, for relapse see here Rituximab maintenance treatment outside of clinical trials is not considered standard"
