As such, there is an increased trend for penile-‍preserving strategies, despite the fact that recurrence rates may be higher than those of radical surgical procedures Patient preference as well as compliance in attending follow-‍up visits after treatment must be considered in treatment decisions Surgical techniques can be grouped into three broad categories: For small volume and superficial penile lesions, circumcision, wide local excision and epithelial ablative techniques are mainstay treatments For glanular and distal penile tumours, it is now possible to preserve much more length, and cosmetic and functional results are far superior to conventional partial penectomy Improvements in preservation techniques: Ongoing studies are evaluating less resection for superficial tumours and more penile reconstruction (phalloplasty) for more advanced tumours suitable only for total penectomy The role of salvage surgery after radio/‍chemotherapy remains controversial For patients with extensive regional disease in which primary surgery is deemed unlikely to result in a clear margin, attempts at down-‍staging are appropriate.
