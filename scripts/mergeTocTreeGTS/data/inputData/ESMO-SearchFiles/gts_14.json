	"text":"Response evaluation DRE is the mainstay of determining complete response after treatment Careful clinical inspection of the inguinal regions is necessary, in addition to radiographic evaluation Biopsies of persistent clinically suspicious lesions 8–12 weeks after completion of CRT are not routinely recommended Good radiographic partial regression can be managed by close follow-‍up to confirm that (a delayed) complete regression takes place (may take 6 months); a decision on the need for salvage surgery should be made following definite assessment at 26 weeks, while residual/‍recurrent tumour should be confirmed histologically prior to radical surgery MRI complements clinical assessment and acts as a useful baseline PET is beneficial for detecting residual sub-‍clinical pelvic or extrapelvic/para-‍aortic node involvement"
