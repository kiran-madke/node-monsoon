Outside a clinical trial, there are insufficient data to support omission, particularly as relapses are difficult to salvage with poor outcomes Based on the good results achieved with rituximab chemotherapy combination regimens +/- RT, high-‍dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (HDCT/‍ASCT) is not recommended in patients who achieve complete remission (CR), even in initially poor-‍risk patients who attain an adequate response to initial therapy In young patients achieving less than a partial response, with an elevated FDG uptake at the post-chemoimmunotherapy PET-CT scan, if residual disease is confirmed by biopsy when feasible, intensification with HDCT/‍ASCT is recommended Post-‍treatment evaluation A PET-CT scan has an excellent negative predictive value However, the high frequency of false positive results necessitates further investigation of positive scans before planned therapy is modified Post-‍treatment PET-CT response evaluation should not be carried out until at least 5–6 weeks from the last chemotherapy infusion Serial scanning may be required to fully evaluate areas of residual post-treatment PET tracer uptake, with many patients manifesting gradual resolution Relapsed/‍refractory PMBCL The probability of recurrence after successful initial therapy for PMBCL appears to be lower than for other DLBCLs Patients who achieve a response lasting longer than 18 months are likely to be cured Salvage treatment strategies of relapsed/resistant patients are similar to nodal DLBCLs, and include attempting reinduction with non-‍cross-‍resistant agents followed by consolidation with HDCT/‍ASCT in patients with chemosensitive disease If not a component of initial therapy, RT should be incorporated into the treatment programme for relapsed disease, ideally post-‍transplant, if significant mediastinal or lung volumes are involved"

	"text":"7.3.6.0 PBoL Anthracycline-‍containing chemotherapy regimens, together with rituximab, are recommended, although the benefit of the addition of rituximab has not been studied in the subset of patients with PBoL The role of consolidation RT is not well-‍defined and R-‍CHOP +/- consolidation RT remains the standard approach for the patients with any stage of DLBCL with bone involvement The requirement for RT to sites of bone involvement should be addressed in appropriately designed prospective randomised trials Where CR has been achieved with chemotherapy, consolidation RT (30–40 Gy) is recommended for localised lesions, with limited additional benefit from the use of extensive radiation volumes The risk of CNS recurrence associated with skeletal involvement is a matter of debate As CNS involvement is low in patients with localised PBoL, CNS prophylaxis is not routinely required An accurate assessment (CSF flow cytometry and brain MRI) and prophylaxis can be recommended in patients with involvement of anatomic areas in close apposition to the CNS (skull and/‍or spine), on the basis of established risk profiling Where pathological fractures are found at presentation, surgical stabilisation for quality of life improvement should be considered only if chemotherapy delays can be avoided Consolidation RT (30–40 Gy) to the fractured bone may be given Initial RT to a fractured bone before chemotherapy does not improve disease outcome but may improve pain and potentially hasten healing"

	"text":"7.3.7.0 Response evaluation Post-‍treatment evaluation is difficult because bone lesions remain detectable upon CT scan PET scan is mandatory in response assessment as in nodal DLBCL, although persistent PET uptake may represent bone healing rather than active disease New treatments such as HDCT/‍ASCT or alternative chemoimmunotherapy are recommended only in the case of biopsy-‍proven persisting disease or clear clinical or radiological progression Finally, long-‍term bone health preventive measures should also be taken into account in patients with PBoL, including evaluation and treatment of any underlying osteoporosis, and/‍or vitamin D deficiency"
