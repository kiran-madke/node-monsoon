This quick reference booklet provides you with the most important content of the full ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) on the management of urogenital cancers (prostate cancer, bladder cancer, renal cell carcinoma, penile cancer and testicular seminoma and non-‍seminoma). Key content includes diagnostic criteria, staging of disease, treatment plans and follow-‍‍up. The ESMO CPG on urogenital cancers are intended to provide you with a set of recommendations for the best standards of care for urogenital cancers, using evidence-‍‍based medicine. Implementation of ESMO CPG facilitates knowledge uptake and helps you to deliver an appropriate quality of focused care to your patients. The approval and licensed indication of drugs mentioned in this pocket guideline may vary in different countries. Please consult your local prescribing information. This booklet can be used as a quick reference guide to access key content on evidence-‍‍based management of urogenital cancers.

	"text":"Diagnosis and pathology High-‍grade prostate cancer can occur in men with a ‘normal’ prostate specific antigen (PSA) level. A single elevated PSA level should not prompt a prostate biopsy and should be verified by a second value The decision whether or not to have a prostate biopsy should be made in the light of digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, ethnicity, age, comorbidities, PSA values, free/‍total PSA, history of previous biopsy and patient values Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-‍guided prostate biopsy should be performed under antibiotic cover and local anaesthesia. A minimum of 10–12 cores should be obtained Prior to repeat biopsy, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended with a view to MRI-‍guided or MRI-‍TRUS fusion biopsy Indications for repeat biopsies include a rising PSA, suspicious DRE, abnormal multi-‍parametric MRI, atypical small acinar proliferation or multifocal high-‍grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia The extent of involvement of each biopsy core and the most common and the worst Gleason grades should be reported Biopsy pathology should be reported using the International Society of Urologic Pathology recommendations"

Localised disease should be classified as low-, intermediate-‍ or high-‍risk as a guide to prognosis and therapy Within the low-‍risk category, higher percentage positive cores, length of core involvement, PSA density and a lower free/‍total PSA ratio are associated with the risk of understaging Patients with intermediate-‍ or high-‍risk disease should have nodal staging using computed tomography (CT), MRI, choline positron emission tomography/CT (PET/‍CT) or pelvic nodal dissection Patients with intermediate-‍ or high-‍risk disease should be staged for metastases using technetium bone scan and thoraco-‍abdominal CT scan or whole body MRI or choline PET/‍CT"
