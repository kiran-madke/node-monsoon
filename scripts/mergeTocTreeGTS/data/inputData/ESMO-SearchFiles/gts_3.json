This quick reference booklet provides you with the most important content of the full ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) and consensus statements on the management of lung cancers (early-stage, locally advanced and metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer [NSCLC], and small-cell lung cancer [SCLC] and chest tumours (malignant pleural mesothelioma and thymic epithelial tumours). Key content includes diagnostic criteria, staging of disease, treatment plans and follow-up. The ESMO CPGs and consensus statements on lung & chest tumours are intended to provide you with a set of recommendations for the best standards of care for lung & chest tumours, using evidence-based medicine. Implementation of ESMO CPGs and consensus statements facilitates knowledge uptake and helps you to deliver an appropriate quality of focused care to your patients. The approval and licensed indication of drugs mentioned in this pocket guideline may vary in different countries. Please consult your local prescribing information. This booklet can be used as a quick reference guide to access key content on evidence-based management of lung & chest tumours. Please visit http://www.esmo.org or http://www.oncologypro.esmo.org to view the full guidelines."
