Eur Urol 2016;70:93–105. Changes to the WHO classification are summarised below The molecular genetic profile of ccRCC is frequently characterised by biallelic Von Hippel-‍Lindau (VHL) gene alterations; mutations in chromatin remodelling genes have also been reported Multilocular cystic ccRCC has been renamed multilocular cystic renal neoplasia of low malignant potential Papillary RCCs represent a heterogeneous disease including tumours with indolent outcome and tumours with aggressive and lethal phenotype. Hereditary leiomyomatosis-associated RCCs are usually Type 2 papillary RCC The oncocytic variant of papillary RCC should be reclassified as Type 1 (mainly) or Type 2 papillary RCC Papillary adenoma is defined as a papillary renal tumour < 15 mm in its largest dimension The main prognostic factors in chromophobe RCC are: tumour stage, presence of necrosis, a sarcomatoid and/‍or rhabdoid component and small vessel invasion Hybrid tumours present overlapping features of oncocytomas and chromophobe RCCs and have indolent behaviour The diagnosis of collecting duct carcinoma is based on six histological features: Medullary location, infiltrative growth pattern, tubular architecture, desmoplastic stromal reaction, high grade atypia and that the tumour is neither an RCC nor a transitional cell carcinoma Renal medullary carcinoma occurs in young patients with sickle traits and is histologically similar to collecting duct carcinoma The diagnosis of MiTF translocation RCCs, which occur in young patients, is based on a strong nuclear TFE3/TFEB immunoreactivity and the presence of a translocation involving TFE3 or TFEB genes: t(X;1)(p11.2;q21) and t(6,11) (p21;q12), respectively Epithelioid angiomyolipoma (AML) is recognised as a separate entity with a risk of progression or metastasis. Risk factors for progression are: association with tuberous sclerosis, multiple AML, presence of necrosis, tumour size > 7 cm, extrarenal extension and/‍or renal vein invasion and presence of a carcinoma-‍like growth pattern Two new entities are now recognised Acquired cystic disease-‍associated RCCs that have indolent outcome and occur in patients with end-‍stage renal disease and acquired cystic disease Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-‍deficient RCCs that occur in patients with germline mutations in an SDH gene Prognostic factors to be reported in routine practice are: Histological subtype; International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) nucleolar grading (ccRCC and papillary RCC only); sarcomatoid and/‍or rhabdoid differentiation that defines a grade 4 tumour; necrosis; microscopic vascular invasion; and tumour node metastasis (TNM) staging"
