	"text":"Recommendations to reduce cardiac toxicity in patients treated by radiotherapy 10.8.2.0 Recomm. to reduce cardiac toxicity in RT Newer irradiation techniques may decrease the risk of radiation-‍induced cardiac disease Linear accelerator photons and multiple-‍field conformal or IMRT are desirable for chest irradiation Cardiac-‍sparing lead block during standard simulator planning will at least partially prevent cardiac irradiation for many patients The use of a four-‍field IMRT technique can offer better sparing than partial shielding as the maximum heart depth is increased Electron beams can be used to treat superficial structures For mediastinal radiotherapy, high energy photons from a linear accelerator should be used to treat patients with equal weighting of anterior and posterior portals Systematically limiting treatment is not recommended since a lower dose may be inadequate to control the disease in some patients"
