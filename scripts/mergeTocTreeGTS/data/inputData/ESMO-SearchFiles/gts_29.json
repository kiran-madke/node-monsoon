This quick reference booklet provides you with the most important content of the full ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) on the management of lymphomas (Hodgkin’s lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, gastric marginal zone lymphoma of MALT type, primary cutaneous lymphomas, peripheral T cell lymphomas, extranodal diffuse large B cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and hairy cell leukaemia). Key content includes diagnostic criteria, staging of disease, treatment plans and follow-​up. The ESMO CPGs on lymphomas are intended to provide you with a set of recommendations for the best standards of care for lymphoma, using evidence-​based medicine. Implementation of ESMO CPGs facilitates knowledge uptake and helps you to deliver an appropriate quality of focused care to your patients. Please note that this document is not exhaustive and it may be important to refer to the full CPGs for critical clinical decision-​making. The approval and licensed indication of drugs mentioned in this pocket guideline may vary in different countries. Please consult your local prescribing information. This booklet can be used as a quick reference guide to access key content on evidence-​based management of lymphomas. Please visit http://www.esmo.org or http://​oncologypro.esmo.org to view the full guidelines."
