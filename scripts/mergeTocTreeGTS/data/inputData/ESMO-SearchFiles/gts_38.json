Larger atypical lymphocytes or prolymphocytes must not exceed 55% CLL cells co-‍express the CD5 antigen and the B-‍cell surface antigens CD19, CD20 and CD23 Distinguishing CLL from other lymphoma entities is crucial Staining for cyclin D1 or SOX 11, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) for detecting translocation (11;14) and FMC7 analysis can help to distinguish CLL from mantle cell lymphoma Negative or lower CD43 expression may help to distinguish marginal zone lymphoma or lymphoblastic lymphoma from CLL According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, CLL and small lymphocytic leukaemia (SLL) are a single entity A diagnosis of SLL requires the presence of lymphadenopathy and/‍or splenomegaly with a peripheral blood B-‍lymphocyte count of ≤ 5 × 109/L The diagnosis of SLL should be confirmed by histopathological evaluation of a lymph node biopsy, when possible In the absence of lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, cytopaenia and clinical symptoms, a monoclonal B-‍lymphocyte count of < 5 × 109/L defines monoclonal B-‍lymphocytosis"
