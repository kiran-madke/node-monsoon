This quick reference booklet provides you with the most important content of the full ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) on upper gastrointestinal (GI) tumours (oesophageal cancer, gastric cancer, biliary cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma). Key content includes diagnostic criteria, staging of disease, treatment plans and follow-‍up. The ESMO CPG on upper GI tumours are intended to provide you with a set of recommendations for the best standards of care for upper GI tumours, using evidence-‍based medicine. Implementation of ESMO CPG facilitates knowledge uptake and helps you to deliver an appropriate quality of focused care to your patients. The approval and licensed indication of drugs mentioned in this pocket guideline may vary in different countries. Please consult your local prescribing information. This booklet can be used as a quick reference guide to access key content on evidence-‍based management of upper GI tumours. Please visit http://www.esmo.org or http:/‍/‍oncologypro.esmo.org to view the full guidelines."

FDG-‍PET should be carried out in patients who are candidates for oesophagectomy A tracheo-‍bronchoscopy should be carried out for tumours at or above the tracheal bifurcation to exclude tracheal invasion In the case of oesophageal SCC due to chronic tobacco and alcohol consumption, meticulous investigation of the oral cavity, oropharynx and hypopharynx by an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist, as well as tracheo-‍bronchoscopy to exclude a synchronous second cancer in the aerodigestive tract, should be carried out In locally advanced (T3/T4) ACs of the oesophago-‍gastric junction (OGJ) infiltrating the anatomic cardia, laparoscopy can be used to rule out peritoneal metastases, which are commonly found in 15% of patients Stage should be reported according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/‍Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) tumour node metastasis (TNM) staging system (7th edition), as shown in the table here Staging should be complemented by medical risk assessment, particularly in patients scheduled for multimodal therapy and/‍or surgery This comprises a differential blood count, liver, pulmonary, cardiac and renal function tests Independently from the body mass index, weight loss confers an increased operative risk, worsens a patient’s quality of life and is associated with poor survival in advanced disease Over half of patients lose more than 5% of their body weight before admission for oesophagectomy and over 40% lose more than 10% The patient’s nutritional status and history of weight loss should be assessed according to the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) and ESPEN guidelines-‍recommended nutritional support is an integral part of the medical care of patients in the curative and palliative settings"
