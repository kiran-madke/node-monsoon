This quick reference booklet provides you with the most important content of the full ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) on the management of urogenital cancers (prostate cancer, bladder cancer, renal cell carcinoma, penile cancer and testicular seminoma and non-‍seminoma). Key content includes diagnostic criteria, staging of disease, treatment plans and follow-‍‍up. The ESMO CPG on urogenital cancers are intended to provide you with a set of recommendations for the best standards of care for urogenital cancers, using evidence-‍‍based medicine. Implementation of ESMO CPG facilitates knowledge uptake and helps you to deliver an appropriate quality of focused care to your patients. The approval and licensed indication of drugs mentioned in this pocket guideline may vary in different countries. Please consult your local prescribing information. This booklet can be used as a quick reference guide to access key content on evidence-‍‍based management of urogenital cancers.

	"text":"Staging and risk assessment Overview A complete history and physical examination should be undertaken, in addition to laboratory tests evaluating full blood counts and renal function Final diagnosis is based on cystoscopy and evaluation of resected tissue; bladder ultrasonography most frequently gives an initial suspicious image Cystoscopic examination and TURBT under anaesthesia should be performed following a standardised protocol Documentation should be made of the number of tumours, their size(s) and the presence of extravesical extension or invasion of adjacent organs by bimanual examination Ideally, both the base of the tumour and the tumour edges should be sent separately to the pathologist to ensure the presence of lamina propria and bladder muscle in the specimen, which is essential for accurate staging When possible, complete resection of all tumour tissue should be achieved Associated carcinoma in situ (CIS) is an adverse prognostic factor and consequently, bladder biopsies should be taken from any reddish, suspicious areas or random biopsies from urothelium with normal appearance if cytology is positive or there is a previous diagnosis of associated CIS Biopsies from the prostatic urethra should be obtained if the tumour is located at the trigone or bladder neck area, or when there is no bladder tumour and the procedure is performed for studying positive cytology, as the tumour could be located in the urothelium lining the prostatic urethra or ducts Muscle-‍invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) should be staged according to the tumour node metastasis (TNM) system and grouped into categories (see table here) For histologically confirmed muscle invasion, local staging can be performed with further imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) CT and MRI can be used to assess extravesicular invasion but often lack the ability to reliably differentiate T2 from T3a, T3b and T4a When an invasive tumour is suspected (by ultrasound or cystoscopy), imaging is recommended before TURBT, if possible, as post-‍TURBT perivesical reactions interfere with the imaging technique CT and MRI are useful to detect enlarged nodes (> 8 mm in the pelvic area and >1 cm in the abdomen) and distant metastasis Hydronephrosis should be taken into account as it is an independent predictor of advanced-‍stage bladder cancer and poor clinical outcome, and it predicts extravesical disease and node-‍positive disease A chest CT scan should be performed at the same time as the abdomino-‍pelvis CT scan Upper urinary tract imaging with either CT urograms, or intravenous (IV) or retrograde pyelograms should be performed to exclude the presence of a synchronous upper tract urothelial tumour Bone scan, chest imaging and other tests may be performed in patients at high risk for metastases"
