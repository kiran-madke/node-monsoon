According to the NCI-‍CTCAE definition, only watery stool is diarrhoea Delineation of stool consistency can be used to optimise management.

	"text":"10.2.2.0 Example of a basic oral care protocol TWO KEY STRATEGIES FOR MITIGATION OF ORAL MUCOSAL INJURY BEFORE AND DURING TREATMENT ARE: Maintenance of optimal nutritional support throughout the entire period of cancer therapy. Developing a daily oral hygiene routine, including brushing teeth and the gums four times a day with a soft brush and using mouth rinses. This approach can contribute to the reduction and, ideally, prevention of oral tissue injury and associated pain, nutritional compromise, and related adverse outcomes. The following information is presented as a portfolio of patient-‍‍based instructions for which health professional guidance is recommended General measures Inspect your oral mucosa daily Have your dental team eliminate sources of trauma (e.g. ill-‍fitting prostheses; fractured teeth) Lubricate lips with (sterile) vaseline/‍‍white paraffin (petrolatum), lip balm, or lip cream. Be aware that vaseline/‍‍white paraffin (petrolatum) should not be used chronically on the lips, as this promotes mucosal cell dehydration and is occlusive leading to risk of secondary infection Drink ample amount of fluids to keep the mouth moist Brushing teeth and gums Use a soft toothbrush or swab (as tolerated) after meals and before sleep. Brushing with a soft toothbrush reduces risk of bleeding. Each month you should utilise a new soft toothbrush Clean the dentition and gingiva with a mild fluoride-‍‍containing, non-‍foaming toothpaste Brush teeth twice a day (after meals and at bedtime) according to the Bass or modified Bass method. If using an electric toothbrush, utilise the techniques cited in the product description instead Rinse the brush thoroughly after use with water and store the toothbrush in a cup with the brush head facing upward If you are used to do so, clean the area between the teeth once a day. Consult a dental hygienist/‍‍dentist about the most appropriate interdental cleaner (floss, toothpick, brushes). In case you are not used to use interdental cleaners on a regular basis, do not start with it while on cancer therapy, since it can break the epithelial barrier, visible through gingival bleeding Rinse mouth Rinse mouth with an alcohol-‍‍free mouthwash upon awakening and at least four times a day after brushing, for 1 min with 15 mL mouthwash; gargle; and then spit out. During the first half hour after rinsing, avoid eating and drinking Denture care Remove dentures before performing oral care. Brush dentures with toothpaste and rinse with water; clean the gums Defer wearing dental prostheses as much as possible until the lining tissues of your mouth are healed. If in the hospital, soak the denture for 10 min in an antimicrobial solution (e.g. chlorhexidine 0.2% if available) before inserting in your mouth"

If patients find the mouthwash painful, they should be advised to use one of these approaches beforehand Analgesics: Expert opinion suggests that, with moderate pain, a topical NSAID (e.g. amlexanox 5% oral paste) may be considered to treat moderate pain from stomatitis. When NSAIDs are not tolerated, consider acetaminophen (paracetamol) as maintenance therapy in combination with an immediate release oral opioid or fast-acting fentanyl preparation (e.g. 50 μg fentanyl nasal spray) to relief pain short term, for instance before dinner. Fast-acting fentanyl preparations are registered for patients who are already treated with opioids, they may also be considered in this population because of their short-‍‍term pain relief Analgesics: Expert opinion suggests that with persistent severe pain more aggressive pain management may be considered to treat severe pain from stomatitis. Since oral complaints can complicate administration of drugs by mouth, one should consider other kinds of administration routes, such as transdermal or intranasal routes Other treatments: Expert opinion suggests that other treatments, such as coating agents, topical analgesic or anti-‍inflammatory agents, topical anaesthetics, and alternative mouthwashes may be considered to treat stomatitis Steroids; topical: Expert opinion suggests that with ulcers topical high potency corticosteroids should be considered first: dexamethasone mouth rinse (0.1 mg/mL) in case several locations of the oral cavity is involved or difficult to reach ulcerations; clobetasol gel or ointment (0.05%) in case of limited locations and easy to approach ulcers to treat mIAS Steroid; intralesional injection: Expert opinion suggests that, with no ulcer resolution, intralesional steroid injection (triamcinolone weekly; total dose 28 mg) in conjunction with oral expert AND topical clobetasol gel or ointment (0.05%) should be considered to treat mIAS Steroids; systemic: Expert opinion suggests that for highly symptomatic ulcers and for recurrent ulcers or oesophageal lesions, systemic corticosteroids as initial therapy to bring symptom under control quickly (high-‍dose pulse 30–60 mg or 1 mg/kg) oral prednisone/‍‍ prednisolone for 1 week followed by dose tapering over the second week should be considered to treat mIAS   Suggestions in favour of an intervention: based on expert opinion. mIAS, mTOR inhibitor-associated mucositis; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; WHO, World Health Organization"
