This quick reference booklet provides you with the most important content of the full ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) on upper gastrointestinal (GI) tumours (oesophageal cancer, gastric cancer, biliary cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma). Key content includes diagnostic criteria, staging of disease, treatment plans and follow-‍‍up. The ESMO CPG on upper GI tumours are intended to provide you with a set of recommendations for the best standards of care for upper GI tumours, using evidence-‍‍based medicine. Implementation of ESMO CPG facilitates knowledge uptake and helps you to deliver an appropriate quality of focused care to your patients. The approval and licensed indication of drugs mentioned in this pocket guideline may vary in different countries. Please consult your local prescribing information. This booklet can be used as a quick reference guide to access key content on evidence-‍‍based management of upper GI tumours.

	"text":"DIAGNOSIS Formal diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is based on either tissue specimen or, in selected cases, very specific computed tomography (CT)/ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, often referred to as ‘non-‍invasive’ criteria Pathological diagnosis of HCC requires a biopsy of the tumour or a resection specimen, and preferably contains surrounding non-tumoural parenchyma for comparison Stromal or tumour cell invasion into the portal tracts or fibrous septa, defines HCC and is not present in dysplastic lesions Other histological features of HCC may also be seen in dysplastic lesions: Increased cell density (more than twice that of the surrounding tissue) with increased nuclear/‍cytoplasm ratio and irregular thin-‍trabecular pattern Intratumoural portal tract(s) Pseudoglandular pattern Diffuse fatty change (up to 40% in early, well-‍differentiated tumours, uncommon in tumours >3 cm) Varying numbers of unpaired arteries Additional immunohistochemical (IHC) staining may be helpful Neovascularisation can be assessed by a CD34 stain Non-‍invasive diagnosis of HCC is only possible in cirrhotic patients and requires state-‍of-‍the-‍art imaging techniques, such as: Multiple-‍phase multidetector CT scan Dynamic contrast-‍enhanced MRI Diagnosis should be based on the identification of the typical vascular hallmark of HCC Hypervascular in the arterial phase with washout in the portal venous or delayed phases Contrast-‍enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is less suitable for non-‍invasive diagnosis of HCC since a lesion that displays hypervascularisation and venous washout on CEUS may also be a cholangiocarcinoma Angiography and 18Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-‍PET) are not recommended for early diagnosis Every decision regarding the biopsy of a focal liver lesion should be discussed by the multidisciplinary team (MDT), including hepatobiliary and transplant surgeons A negative biopsy does not rule out malignancy There is no indication for biopsy of a focal lesion in a cirrhotic liver in the following situations: When no form of therapy can be offered because of serious comorbidity In cases of decompensated cirrhosis and the patient is on the waiting list for liver transplantation When the patient is a candidate for resection that can be carried out with an acceptable morbidity and mortality risk"
