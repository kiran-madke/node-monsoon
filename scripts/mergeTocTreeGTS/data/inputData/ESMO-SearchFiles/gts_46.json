TNM 8 staging, alongside the patient’s cardiopulmonary fitness, should be used to determine the choice of treatment In the UICC TNM 8, the T stage has been further subdivided according to tumour size: T1 into T1a ≤ 1 cm, T1b > 1 cm to ≤ 2 cm, T1c > 2 cm to ≤ 3 cm T2 into T2a > 3 cm to ≤ 4 cm, T2b > 4 cm to ≤ 5 cm T3 > 5 cm to ≤ 7 cm T4 > 7 cm For part-‍solid tumours, the size of the invasive component should be used to assign the T category for clinical staging; however the whole size of the tumour should also be recorded Subsolid lesions require dedicated radiological expertise to evaluate the lung lesion composition The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) has proposed: determining the T of multifocal ground glass/‍lepidic tumours by the highest T-‍lesion, with either the number of tumours or m in parentheses to denote the multifocal nature; and that a single N and M category be used for all these lesions collectively In daily practice, simply using m is preferred over trying to estimate the number of ground glass opacity (GGO) areas For pneumonic tumours, the IASLC suggests using size (or T3) if in one lobe, T4 if involving a different ipsilateral lobe, and M1a if contralateral; in this situation, the T stage will be based on the highest category in the most involved lung CT follow-‍up studies have shown that incidental non-‍calcified non-‍solid lung lesions do not need repeat CT examinations more frequently than every 1–2 years; these lesions are definitely less aggressive than solid or part-‍solid lesions and often even indolent If two lung lesions fulfil the criteria for two primaries, then these should be evaluated, staged and treated accordingly Concluding that two foci are indeed two different primaries is difficult; often it will be impossible to come to a definitive conclusion and the role of an MDT is important The TNM 8 staging suggests leaving the N categories unchanged from TNM 7, but suggests recording for future testing the sub-‍classification of single (N1a, N2a) or multiple (N1b, N2b) affected nodes For patients with abnormal mediastinal and/‍or hilar LNs using CT and/‍or PET, endosonography is recommended over surgical staging The preferred first technique for pathological confirmation of suspect nodes is needle aspiration under EBUS and/‍or EUS guidance If EBUS and/‍or EUS does not reveal nodal involvement in a situation of high clinical suspicion, mediastinoscopy is indicated Mediastinoscopy is the test with the highest negative predictive value (NPV) to rule out mediastinal LN disease A suggested algorithm for the locoregional staging of LNs is shown here Screening for brain metastases by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be useful in patients considered for curative therapy"

	"text":"4.6.0.0 Pretreatment risk assessment A therapeutic intervention for lung cancer reduces the pulmonary and vascular reserve capacity, either acutely following resection, or more gradually following radiotherapy (RT) Functional loss needs to be estimated pre-‍therapy to determine whether the patient will be able to cope and maintain an acceptable quality of life The risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality can be estimated using riskspecific models, although none have been validated in a cancer population In non-‍metastatic NSCLC, the cardiopulmonary fitness of the patient will determine the choice of treatment; before considering surgical resection, precise assessment of cardiac and pulmonary function is necessary to estimate risk of operative morbidity Formal lung function testing should be used to estimate postoperative lung function. An example preoperative respiratory evaluation algorithm here Surgical resection is usually acceptable if the predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) values are > 40% For patients with FEV1 and DLCO values > 80% of their predicted pulmonary function tests and no other major comorbidities, no further investigations are advised before surgical resection For others, exercise testing and split lung function are recommended; maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) can be used to measure exercise capacity and predict postoperative complications Standard risk assessments are not always directly applicable, as resection of poorly functioning parts of the lung might improve the situation instead of making it worse For example, in patients with limited pulmonary function due to emphysema, a lung volume reduction effect may be observed by resection of the lung cancer within emphysematous lung tissue. Treatment of such patients is considered in the algorithm here For cardiac assessment, use of the recalibrated thoracic revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) shown in the table below is recommended.
