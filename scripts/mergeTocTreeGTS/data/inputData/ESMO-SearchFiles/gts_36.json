Implementation of ESMO CPGs facilitates knowledge uptake and helps you to deliver an appropriate quality of focused care to your patients. Please note that this document is not exhaustive and it may be important to refer to the full CPGs for critical clinical decision-‍making. The approval and licensed indication of drugs mentioned in this pocket guideline may vary in different countries. Please consult your local prescribing information. This booklet can be used as a quick reference guide to access key content on evidence-‍based management of lymphomas.
