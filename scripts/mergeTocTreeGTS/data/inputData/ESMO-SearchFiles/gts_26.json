Key content includes central venous access in oncology; prevention of chemotherapy-‍‍ and radiotherapy induced nausea and vomiting; and management of febrile neutropenia, mucositis, venous thromboembolism, extravasation associated with the administration of chemotherapeutic agents and of the cardiotoxic effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The ESMO CPG and consensus statements covered in this booklet are intended to provide you with a set of recommendations for the best standards of supportive care, using evidence-‍‍based medicine. Implementation of ESMO CPG and consensus statements facilitates knowledge uptake and helps you to deliver an appropriate quality of focused care to your patients. The approval and licensed indication of drugs mentioned in this pocket guideline may vary in different countries. Please consult your local prescribing information. This booklet can be used as a quick reference guide to access key content on supportive care in cancer. Please visit http://www.esmo.org or http://oncologypro.esmo.org to view the full guidelines."

If venous access continually proves difficult, placement of a CVAD should be considered Large veins in the forearm are recommended for peripheral administration Avoid cannulation over joints, the inner wrist and lower extremities Veins in the anticubital fossa or on the dorsum of the hand should not be used, particularly for vesicant drugs Avoid cannulation where lymphoedema is present Cannulation on the side of a mastectomy is still a matter of discussion Procedures After cannulation, blood flow should be checked; rinse with 10 mL of normal saline and check for signs of extravasation Flushing with 10–20 mL of saline solution between different drug infusions is recommended A blood return (flashback) should always be obtained before vesicants are administered and checked regularly throughout a bolus infusion Continue monitoring of the cannula insertion site and check regularly for symptoms such as swelling, pain, redness or a sluggish infusion rate (highly recommended during infusion of all drugs) Bolus dosages of vesicant drugs may be administered concurrently with fast-running infusions of compatible IV fluid"
